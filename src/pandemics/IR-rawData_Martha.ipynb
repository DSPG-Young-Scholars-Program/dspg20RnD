       "'Plague is a zoonosis that is present in wild rodent populations worldwide and is transmitted primarily by fleas. Yersinia pestis, the plague bacillus, is unique among the enteric group of gram-negative bacteria in having adopted an arthropod-borne route of transmission. Y. pestis has evolved in such a way as to be transmitted during the brief encounter between a feeding flea and a host. A transmissible infection primarily depends on the ability of Y. pestis to grow in the flea as a biofilm that is embedded in a complex extracellular matrix. Bacteria in the biofilm phenotype are deposited into the dermis together with flea saliva, elements which cannot be satisfactorily mimicked by needle-injection of Y. pestis from laboratory cultures. The objective of this project is to identify and determine the function of Y. pestis genes that mediate flea-borne transmission and the initial encounter with the host innate immune system at the infection site in the skin. We study the interaction of Y. pestis with its insect vector by using an artificial feeding apparatus to infect fleas with uniform doses of Y. pestis parent and mutant strains. We seek to identify Y. pestis genes that are required for the bacteria to infect the flea midgut and to produce a biofilm that blocks the flea foregut and that is required for efficient transmission. The strategy entails first identifying bacterial genes that are differentially expressed in the flea by gene expression analysis and other techniques. Specific mutations are then introduced into these genes, and the mutants tested for their ability to infect and block the flea vector. Identification of such transmission factors allows further studies into the molecular mechanisms of the bacterial infection of the flea vector. Detailed understanding of the interaction with the insect host may lead to novel strategies to interrupt the transmission cycle. We have also established in vitro methods to infect fleas and to monitor transmission dynamics of fleas over a one-month period following their infectious blood meal.  With this system we are able to compare the relative importance of the two modes of transmission and the relative vector competence of different flea species.  Our studies of flea vector competence and vectorial capacity will be useful to develop more realistic mathematical modeling of the epidemiology of plague transmission and the conditions that lead to plague epizootics.     During FY2017, we published a study on the comparative vector competence of the North American ground squirrel flea O. montana and the rat flea X. cheopis.  The work described new protocols to monitor and compare the infection and transmission dynamics of different flea vector species following a single standardized infectious blood meal.  Several recent papers cite that O. montana rarely if ever transmits by the biofilm-dependent mechanism, whereas X. cheopis is the vector par excellence by this mechanism. However, we demonstrated that both fleas are proficient at this transmission mechanism, thereby correcting a misconception.  Another aspect of this study was to compare the kinetics and temporal patterns of transmission during the early-phase and later phase transmission windows.  We found that the later, biofilm-dependent transmission mechanism was much more efficient than early-phase transmission.  We also published evidence for our proposed model for the early-phase transmission mechanism.  Early-phase transmission was long assumed to be mechanical, via contaminated mouthparts.  However, we proposed a regurgitative model based on the striking finding that dense bacterial aggregates associated with a rough, amorphous, brown-colored, waxy-looking material localized to the foregut within a few hours after an infectious blood meal.  In some fleas, these bacterial aggregates could obstruct blood flow during the fleas next feeding attempt, which correlated with transmission.  Thus, we proposed a unified theory of flea-borne transmission in which both early and later transmission modes occur by regurgitation from fleas in which the foregut is obstructed by masses of Y. pestis at different stages of biofilm maturation. We refined and evaluated new experimental systems to maintain and monitor infection status and transmission efficiency of individual fleas at different times after infection.  The data will be used to estimate values for important parameters such as the probability of flea vectors developing a transmissible infection after feeding on a bacteremic host and the transmission efficiency during a four-week period after infection.  Limited data are available are currently available for these values, which are needed for understanding plague epidemiology.  In collaboration with Dr. Angela Luis at the University of Montana, we have developed mathematical models to better understand conditions that give rise to periodic plague epizootics, and will use our experimentally derived data in these models.  In 2017 we published a summary of many of our experimental protocols for infecting and monitoring fleas on the BEI Resources website (https://www.beiresources.org/Catalog/VectorResources.aspx) as part of their program to provide arthropod vector resources widely available to the research community.We established a collaboration with USGS and USFWS biologists working on a sylvatic plague vaccine for prairie dogs in Montana and South Dakota.  Prairie dog colonies are subject to periodic explosive plague epizootics that can essentially extirpate the colony, which pose a public danger to rural communities and hinder efforts to reintroduce the black-footed ferret, an endangered species.  The conditions that give rise to prairie dog epizootics are enigmatic.  Based on one limited 1940 study, the predominant flea of prairie dogs, O. hirsuta, is a poor vector.  Because of this, alternate transmission routes in addition to the classic flea-borne route have been proposed, none of which add up. We will use our flea infection and transmission monitoring experimental systems to reevaluate the vector competence of prairie dog fleas, which will be collected and provided to us by our USGS and USFWS collaborators.  Similarly, Dr. James Belthoff, Boise State University, is providing P. irritans fleas, which we will also evaluate. This flea is thought to be a poor vector but has controversially been hypothesized to have transmitted Y. pestis from human to human during the European plague epidemics of the Middle Ages.  Reliable vector competence data regarding these fleas will enable more realistic modeling of these epizootiologic/epidemiologic scenarios. In collaboration with the Genomics Unit of the RML Research Technologies Branch, we are examining and characterizing the transcriptomes of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and our biofilm-producing Y. pseudotuberculosis mutant during growth in vitro and during infection of the flea, with the goal of identifying genes and gene regulatory pathways that are important for flea-borne transmission. The in vivo and in vitro transcriptomic comparisons between these three strains are designed to broadly identify candidate components of biofilm regulatory pathways and other genes important for the recent evolutionary adaptation to flea-borne transmission. Significant differences in the expression of orthologous genes in the flea might be indicative of evolutionary changes in gene regulatory pathways.  In a second collaboration with the Genomics Unit, the gene expression response of the flea digestive tract epithelial cells to sterile and infected blood meals was characterized and compared to that of unfed fleas.  Data analysis will disclose the flea digestive system pathways and immune response to oral infection with Y. pestis, about which nothing is known.'"

       " 'An insect society can serve as a hub of transmission for pathogens, commensals, and mutualists (symbionts), but transmission within a colony occurs between close relatives.  If this consanguineous transmission is much more prevalent than between-colony transmission, selection may favor more benevolent symbiont strains in social hosts in comparison to solitary hosts, because high consanguineous transmission may couple the fitness of the symbiont to that of the host colony. To test this hypothesis, genetic covariances between social and solitary sweat bee hosts and their nematode symbionts are being measured to represent effective transmission. Effective transmission is a measure of within- versus between-colony transmission, and therefore provides a means to measure the coupling of host and symbiont fitnesses. Laboratory colonies of social and solitary hosts either with or without symbionts will be used to measure the impacts of infection on host fitness. This research will also determine if genetic covariances can predict the impact of a symbiont on its host. This project will involve the training undergraduates, including students from underrepresented groups. Additionally, this research has direct relevance to the understanding of disease dynamics in social systems of all kinds, from humans to slime molds.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The respiratory tract is a major portal for pathogens. The bronchoalveolar macrophage, positioned at the mucosal surface, recognizes  pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)  through structures called  pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).  A family of closely related mammalian PRRs, the  Toll-like receptors (TLRs),  are transmembrane signaling molecules that respond to diverse PAMPs. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram negative bacteria stimulates macrophages through TLR4 to elicit a pattern of gene expression that is strongly proinflammatory, e.g., TNF-a, IL-1¿, IL-12, and IFN-? resulting in a  Th1-type  cytokine milieu. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants and young children worldwide, and has recently been attributed to increased morbidity and mortality in the elderly and immunosuppressed. In a failed clinical trial, a formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine led to exacerbated RSV disease. Vaccine-enhanced RSV disease, demonstrated by histopathology and airway hyperreactivity, are faithfully recapitulated in the cotton rat (S. hispidus), and is associated with a Th2-type pattern of cytokine gene expression. Vaccination with FI-RSV and a TLR4 agonist mitigates enhanced disease. Recently, the RSV fusion (F) protein was shown to be a TLR4 agonist. In vitro, cotton rat macrophages respond to LPS and F protein to elicit the same spectrum of inflammatory genes, although the F protein is less potent. The overall hypothesis to be tested is that the interaction of F protein with TLR4 is essential for establishment of a Thl-type milieu and that formalin fixation of RSV destroys the capacity of F to interact with TLR4, resulting in a Th2-type response. This proposal details novel experimental approaches: (i) to evaluate the contribution and regulation of F protein signaling through TLR4 to the development of a Th1-type cytokine profile, (ii) to determine the role of TLR4 in the development of RSV-mediated disease in vivo, and (iii) to determine if polymorphic forms of TLR4 previously associated with airway hyporesponsiveness to LPS exhibit diminished sensitivity to F protein and if they are overrepresented in a population at high risk for RSV. It is expected that at the completion of this grant, we will have determined the molecular basis for primary and vaccine-enhanced RSV disease, and have identified strategies for the development of a human RSV vaccine.',\n",
       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of severe lower respiratory tract illness ininfants and the elderly. Currently, no safe and efficacious RSV vaccine exists. Advances in ourunderstanding of immunity and disease pathogenesis associated with RSV infection have revealed that RSVG protein contains a CX3C chemokine motif that interacts with the CX3CR1 chemokine receptor, modifiesthe activities of CX3CL1, and affects aspects of immunity and disease pathogenesis. Antibodies to G proteininduced in the acute response to RSV vaccination or natural infection inhibit G protein CX3C-CX3CR1interaction; however, it is unclear if anti-G protein antibody responses protect from disease pathogenesis.The long-term goal of our research is to determine the regions in RSV G protein that induce a protectiveantibody response which block G protein CX3C-CX3CR1 interaction to provide the foundation for thedevelopment of safe and efficacious RSV vaccine candidates. Our central hypothesis is that modifications tothe G protein which eliminate the CX3C motif may improve vaccine safety while induction of antibodies thatblock this interaction may improve vaccine efficacy. The proposal will take advantage of a well-defined CX3Cchemokine binding and leukocyte migration assay, panels of anti-G protein monoclonal antibodies, panels ofG protein peptides and polypeptides, and well-defined mouse model. Using these reagents we will examinethe following specific aims: 1) Determine regions in the G protein that induce antibodies which block Gprotein CX3C binding to CX3CR1; 2) Determine the ability of antibodies that block G protein CX3C binding toCX3CR1 to inhibit the pulmonary inflammatory response associated with RSV infection, or formalin-inactivated (FI-RSV) vaccine enhanced disease; 3) Determine the association between antibodies that blockG protein binding to CX3CR1 and leukocyte migration and severity of RSV disease in humans. Theproposed research is innovative because it will identify regions in the RSV G protein that induce antibodieswhich block RSV disease, and provide critical information on humoral responses associated with inhibitingRSV G protein CX3C-CX3CR1 interaction to prevent disease.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term objective of this work is to understand the mechanism of synaptic transmission in sensory receptor cells in the ear, eye and other sensory systems that use graded transmission at ribbon-class synapses. This specialized form of chemical signaling appears to be an adaptation to allow the transmission of information about small changes in sensory input that would be lost during conventional synaptic transmission that uses action potentials. The proposed experiments will investigate the physiology, anatomy and biochemistry of these synapses. The work on sensory receptors (hair cells) in the ear will use frogs and zebrafish as model species. The zebrafish work will also study photoreceptors and bipolar cells in the retina, and hair cells in the lateral line organs. All of these calls have ribbon-class synapses. These species were chosen for study because of the cellular and molecular tools that are available to answer fundamental questions in synaptic physiology. In the case of frogs, there is also a wealth of information already available upon which to build. During the past 10 years, several laboratories have developed techniques that allow detailed electrophysiological analysis of synaptic transmission using tight-seal voltage clamp to measure small changes in membrane capacitance to observe synaptic transmission on a millisecond time scale. This physiological method will be used in conjunction with electron tomography and recently developed membrane tracer dyes to study the ultra structure of the synaptic vesicle cycle ribbon synapses. The goal is to test several key hypotheses concerning the function of the synaptic  ribbon , the prominent anatomical feature for which these synapses are named. The project will also focus on two major proteins (calretinin and parvalbumin 3) that are believed to serve central roles in synaptic transmission in these cells by capturing and transporting calcium ions away from the synapses. The project will investigate the important biochemical properties that determine how fast these proteins bind calcium, how much calcium they can sequester, and how fast they can diffuse within the cell. These properties are central to understanding synaptic transmission in hair cells, and have a wider relevance to the proposed function of these and related calcium-binding proteins in protection from calcium overload during strokes and other brain injuries. The genetic and molecular tools developed by zebrafish researchers during the past decade will allow a direct test the function of a protein (Ribeye) that has recently been identified as a major component of the ribbon.',\n",
       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important respiratory pathogen in infancy and early childhoodand is associated with the development of long-term airway inflammation and hyperreactivity whosemechanisms remain unclear. Our recent research (HL-61007) has shown that RSV makes rat airwaysabnormally susceptible to neurogenic inflammation through mechanisms involving the increased expressionof nerve growth factor (NGF) and its trkA and p75 receptors, and we have confirmed overexpression ofneurotrophic factors [NGF and brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF)] and trkA receptors in the lowerairways of human infants with RSV bronchiolitis. We also found that the recruitment of lymphocytes andmonocytes to infected airways is amplified by concomitant stimulation of substance P (SP)-containing sensory afferents and that RSV induces maturation of large numbers of mast cells in close juxtaposition withthese nerve fibers, whose activation triggers the synthesis/release of leukotrienes in the airways.Furthermore, our studies indicate that the potentiation of neurogenic inflammation persists long afterresolution of the acute RSV infection and that neurogenic responses to RSV in young rats are qualitativelyand quantitatively different from adult rats. Starting from these observations, we now hypothesize thatdysregulation of the expression of neurotrophins [NGF, BDNF, and neurotrophins (NT) 3 and 4) and theirreceptors (trkA/B/C and p75) in developing airways by early-life RSV infection leads to remodeling of the sensorineural network in the respiratory tract and to development of complex neuro-immune interactions thatamplify and protract airway inflammation and hyperreactivity. We also hypothesize, based on preliminary data, that exposure to hyperoxia in the neonatal period modifies the effect of the virus on the expression ofneurotrophic factors and receptors. Finally, we hypothesize that RSV-induced changes in neurotrophin expression are responsible for the aberrant responses of cellular effectors of inflammation and allergy to thestimulation of sensory nerves. The following specific aims are organized around the evaluation of thesehypotheses: 1) To study the changes in expression and localization of neurotrophins and neurotrophinreceptors in the lungs resulting from early-life RSV infection, and correlate these changes to neurogenicinflammation; 2) To determine the role of neurotrophins and neurotrophin receptors in the recruitment and activation of lymphocytes and monocytes into the respiratory tract infected with RSV; and 3) To analyze therole of neurotrophins and neurotrophin receptors in the differentiation of mast cells and modulation of theleukotriene pathway in the respiratory tract infected with RSV. These studies will provide new importantinformation concerning neuro-immune interactions in RSV-infected airways and on the pathogenesis of post-RSV childhood asthma, and may lead to new therapeutic and prophylactic strategies.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Novel intervention strategies are needed to reduce HIV incidence in the US below the current 40K plateau. The highly-infectious acute phase of initial infection represents a promising but relatively unexplored target for behavioral change interventions. Interventions that identify acutely-infected persons and help them reduce their risk of transmitting the virus to others could play an important role in efforts to reduce HIV incidence below the 40K plateau. However, the ultimate impact of these interventions depends on the actual extent of transmission during the acute phase of infection, as well as on the cost-effectiveness of potential interventions to reduce acute-phase HIV transmission. To enhance current understanding of the epidemiological impact of acute-phase HIV transmission and the cost-effectiveness of potential strategies to reduce HIV transmission during this period of elevated infectiousness, we will: 1) Develop mathematical models and procedures to estimate the annual number of incident HIV infections due to acute-phase transmission, the total number of such infections from 1998 through 2004, and the potential epidemiological and economic impact of interventions to reduce acute-phase HIV transmission. 2) Assess the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of supplementing existing HIV counseling and testing services with HIV-RNA testing of pooled test samples to facilitate identification of acutely-infected persons and encourage behavioral risk reduction to prevent acute-phase HIV transmission. 3) Assess the costs and estimate the number of HIV infections averted by a comprehensive post-exposure prophylaxis program that combined antiretroviral prophylaxis with either a 2-session behavioral risk reduction intervention or a more intensive 5-session intervention. This project will provide estimates of the magnitude and consequences of acute-phase HIV transmission, and the potential economic efficiency of various intervention strategies to prevent transmission during the acute phase of infection. This information is needed by decision makers at federal, state, and local levels who must prioritize HIV prevention intervention development and implementation. The results will inform scientific and policy discussions on the importance of interventions to reduce acute-phase transmission.',\n",
       " 'Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is the leading killer worldwide among infectious diseases,incurring 2-3 million deaths annually. Defining the mechanisms of HIV transmission and understanding therole of host cells that participate in the process are essential in developing effective strategies to combat HIVinfection. Dendritic cells (DC) perform an important role in HIV infection and dissemination. DC-SIGN, a C-type lectin predominately expressed on myeloid DC, has been identified as a key mediator of DC-mediatedHIV transmission. However, the precise mechanisms of DC-enhanced HIV infection and the role of DC-SIGNin the viral transmission process remain elusive. Our long-term objective is to elucidate the mechanisms ofDC-mediated HIV dissemination and understand their role in HIV pathogenesis. The proposed studies willfacilitate understanding of the mechanisms and the development of more effective interventions against HIVtransmission, and potentially aid in development of novel HIV vaccine strategies. We hypothesize that cell-type-dependent HIV trafficking determines efficiency of DC-SIGN- or DC-mediated HIV transmission, andHIV Nef protein regulates DC-mediated HIV transmission through modulation of CD4 and DC-SIGNexpression. This hypothesis is based on the observations that 1) DC-SIGN-mediated HIV transmission iscell-type dependent and requires cell-cell contact. The ability of DC-SIGN to promote HIV transfer correlateswith the localization of the viral particles on the DC-SIGN-expressing cell; 2) CD4 coexpression in DC-SIGNtransfectants abolishes HIV transmission to T cell targets. HIV Nef protein downregulates CD4 expression,but upregulates DC-SIGN expression and promotes HIV spread; 3) HIV transmission efficiency issignificantly enhanced by maturation of DC, and the enhanced viral transmission is independent of DC-SIGN. Localization of HIV in immature DC is distinct from that in mature DC. The specific aims of thisproposal are to: 1. Characterize cell-type restriction of DC-SIGN-mediated HIV transmission. 2. Examine therole of CD4 and Nef proteins in modulation of DC-SIGN-mediated HIV transmission. 3. Identify mechanismsof maturation of DC enhancing HIV transmission. These experimental designs will yield a better molecularand cellular description of HIV interactions with DC, which have relevance to control of HIV mucosaltransmission and understanding of viral pathogenesis.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of viral lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. In addition, RSV causes serious disease in elderly and immune compromised individuals. Immunization against RSV is associated with enhanced disease and pulmonary eosinophilia following natural infection that is thought to be caused by an exuberant memory CD4 Th2 response. As a consequence, there is currently no approved RSV vaccine and detailed studies directed towards prevention of vaccine-associated disease are a necessary first step in the development of a safe and effective vaccine. The BALB/c mouse model of RSV infection faithfully mimics the human respiratory disease including the development of extensive lung inflammation and injury, pulmonary eosinophilia, and enhanced disease in mice previously immunized with either formalin inactivated (FI)-RSV or a recombinant vaccinia virus (vv) that expresses the attachment (G) glycoprotein. Memory CD4 T cells secreting Th2 cytokines are necessary for this response because their depletion eliminates eosinophilia. Recent studies have demonstrated that RSV- specific CD8 T cells can inhibit Th2-mediated pulmonary eosinophilia in vvG-primed mice by as yet unknown mechanisms. By taking advantage of our ability to track RSV G-specific CD4 T cells, we will determine the mechanism of memory CD8 T cell inhibition of RSV G-induced pulmonary eosinophilia. Importantly, recent work has provided evidence that vvG and FI-RSV immunization may induce RSV vaccine-enhanced disease via unique mechanisms. Therefore, we will also ascertain if RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells can prevent FI-RSV vaccine-enhanced disease. The overall goal of this proposal is to define the mechanism(s) of how RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells inhibit CD4 T cell-mediated RSV vaccine-enhanced disease and immunopathology. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To determine the how memory CD8 T cells inhibit RSV-specific memory Th2 cells and RSV vaccine-enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia and, 2) To determine if memory CD8 T cells can prevent FI-RSV vaccine-enhanced disease and pulmonary injury. The underlying mechanisms of RSV vaccine-enhanced disease remain unclear. The studies in this proposal are designed to determine the role of RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells in decreasing the severity of CD4 T cell-mediated immunopathology in a model system with direct relevance to human disease.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 1967, the formalin-inactivated vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) primed infants and children to develop an enhanced form of lower respiratory tract disease upon exposure to RSV in the community. Thirty-seven years later, the mechanism of illness of this enhanced disease remains unclear. Furthermore, why inactivated vaccines against this virus elicit non-protective antibody is not understood. No vaccine against RSV has been licensed since. We use a novel mouse model of enhanced disease to address these questions. We hypothesize that affinity maturation of RSV-specific B cells is required for development of a protective antibody response against RSV. We further hypothesize that immunization of RSV- naive mice with nonreplicating RSV vaccines activates B cells that do not undergo affinity maturation and therefore elicits a non-protective RSV-specific antibody response. This non-protective response results in immune complex formation and deposition in the lungs and enhanced disease. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether the method of RSV inactivation is important for vaccine-enhanced disease. 2) Determine the role of RSV F and G protective antigens in vaccine-enhanced disease. 3) Determine whether vaccine-enhanced disease is associated with the lack of affinity maturation of the B cell response to FIRSV, and therefore can be prevented by promoting affinity maturation of the B cell response to FIRSV.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A prominent theory about Alzheimer's disease (AD) proposes that early cognitive deficits are due to subtle alterations in synaptic transmission, but specific AD-related changes in synaptic transmission are not well understood. In order to better understand the role of synaptic deficits during the early stages of AD, we must study the effects of AD-related proteins on synaptic transmission in a mammalian central nervous system preparation. Two proteins that have been strongly implicated in AD-related synaptic dysfunction are amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin. We have recently shown that overexpression of APP depresses synaptic transmission through both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms, and that this depression depends on production of amyloid beta peptide (A?). It remains to be determined which specific isoform of A? (A?40 or A?42) is the relevant ligand, and which surface receptors (if any) is responsible mediating its effects. Presenilin is a critical component of ?-secretase, an enzyme required for A? production. Presenilin is also known to influence storage and release of calcium from internal stores. Changes in the levels of intracellular calcium are a critical signal for many pathways inside the cell, including signals that tell neurons how much neurotransmitter to release when they fire an action potential. Thus, changes in presenilin levels or function could affect synaptic transmission by altering either A? production or intracellular calcium levels. Our long-term objective is to develop a model system that will allow us to investigate the molecules and signaling pathways that are responsible for synaptic dysfunction underlying cognitive deficits associated with AD. We will focus initially on PS1 and APP. Specific Aim 1 of this proposal is to identify the role of wild-type PS1 in synaptic transmission and test the hypothesis that expression of Familial AD-linked mutant PS1 alters synaptic transmission. Specific Aim 2a is to determine whether elevated levels of secreted A?42 depress transmission at excitatory synapses, and whether either A240 or the caspase cleavage-resistant mutant APPD664A can reduce this depression. Specific Aim 2b is to identify the role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, NMDA receptors, group I metabotropic glutamate receptors, and insulin receptors in APP-mediated depression of synaptic transmission. Our experimental strategy is to use electrophysiological and optical imaging techniques to identify specific changes in neurotransmission produced by virally-mediated overexpression of wild-type and mutant forms of presenilin, APP, and APP-cleavage products in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. Our lab has extensive experience studying the effects of virally-mediated overexpression of a variety of proteins on synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons, and is, therefore, in an excellent position to exploit this system to identify the effects of AD-related proteins on neurotransmission. These studies will provide molecular targets for novel therapies to improve cognitive function and delay further neurodegeneration in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of cognitive deficits in the aged, and is thought to begin with synaptic dysfunction. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this synaptic dysfunction will provide new targets for therapeutic treatments to relieve symptoms, and slow or perhaps even stop disease progression.\",\n",
       " 'The long-term objective of the proposed research is to study the modulatory actions of endocannabinoids on synaptic transmission in the CNS. The experimental model involves identified mixed electrical and chemical, (glutamatergic) synapses between eighth nerve auditory primary afferents and the goldfish Mauthner (M-) cell and neighboring (GABA/Glycine) inhibitory terminals. While most studies describing the role of endocannabinoids on synaptic transmission have utilized in-vitro systems, this preparation uniquely allows continuous monitoring and quantification of changes in electrical and chemical transmission in-vivo. Sofar, endocannabinoids have been reported to depress chemical synaptic transmission via presynaptic activation of cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CBIRs). Contrasting this notion, our preliminary results show that activation ofCBIRs enhances synaptic transmission at these inputs on the M-cell. Intradendritic recordings, molecular biology techniques, and immunocytochemistry, will be used to test specific hypotheses and mechanisms underlying modifications of synaptic transmission induced by this agonist. Aim 1, explores the action of different cannabinoid agonists and endocannabinoids on the synaptic efficacy of mixed synapses and inhibitory terminals. It is based on data suggesting that activation of CB1R leads to long-lasting enhancement of both electrical and chemical transmission at mixed synapses. These changes also included nearby inhibitory terminals. I will explore the actions of locally applied cannabinoid agonists and endocannabinoids on unitary and population synaptic responses and membrane conductances that are relevant for the function of this auditory input. Aim 2 is to investigate the mechanisms underlying these long-term changes in synaptic transmission. It is based on the finding that dopamine receptor antagonists block the potentiation triggered by CB1R activation. We have previously reported the presence of a dopaminergic innervation and application of dopamine evoked lasting enhancements of the synaptic response. We will test the hypothesis that cannabinoid-evoked potentiation is mediated via dopamine release from neighboring varicosities. We will also ask under which physiological conditions and from which particular cell type endocannabinoids are released. The proposed research addresses the concept that modulation of intercellular communication by endocannabinoids is not restricted to chemical synapses but also include gap-junction mediated electrical synapses. Moreover, based on a functional interaction with the dopaminergic system, it can lead to long-term potentiation of synaptic responses. This modulatory action could constitute a widespread property, relevant not only to normal brain function in structures such as the basal ganglia, retina, and neocortex where both forms of transmission co-exist, but also to numerous health- related issues such as drug abuse.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the most common cause of respiratory disease leading to hospitalization in children. Preterm infants are especially susceptible to severe RSV infection. Respiratory epithelium is an initial site of RSV infection and epithelial cells along with alveolar macrophages (AM) and dendritic cells (DC) are vital to innate and adaptive immune responses. However, the extent of innate immune gene expression by epithelia and AM-DC in preterm infants can be variable/limited. The hypothesis is that: Reduced innate immunity by respiratory epithelia and AM-DC preterm enhances susceptibility to RSV infection This hypothesis is based on the facts above and our preliminary data in lambs demonstrating limited expression of surfactant proteins A and D (SP-AD), sheep beta-defensin-1 (SBD-1), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) preterm. It will be tested in preterm lambs which have close similarities with human disease including susceptibility, lesions, and innate immunity. Specific Aim 1 compares expression of key innate immune genes (SBD-1, SP-AD, TLR4) and protein/peptide production in vivo as well as AM-DC cytokine expression in pre- and full-term lung. It also tests the hypothesis that limited epithelial cell proliferation and/or differentiation pre-term underlie(s) the mechanistic basis for limited SP-AD, SDB-1 expression and tests this by comparing transcriptional activity, protein/peptide production in pre- and full term cultured cells with or without cell proliferation and differentiation. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that SP-AD, SBD-1 and AM-DC responses to RSV are less at pre- than full-term in the lamb model and in vitro with cultured epithelial cells. A second hypothesis, that increased cell proliferation and/or differentiation of epithelia protects against RSV infection, will be tested in vitro with treatments from Aim 1. The extent to which SP-AD, SBD-1 directly prevent RSV infection will be tested with RNAi assays. Specific Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that yet other innate immune genes expressed with cell proliferation/differentiation prevent RSV infection. This Aim uses gene expression profiling of primary polarized human lung cells and a respiratory epithelia-specific probe set (Unigene) that is the most well-annotated and defined gene target set to date. It also identifies ovine orthologs of human genes and test for impaired/reduced expression preterm. This team combines veterinary and human medical expertise to attain the goal of this project: to discover the reason(s) for inadequate expression of SP-AD, SBD-1 and other innate immune genes as well as AMDC responses at preterm that predispose to RSV infection. The work is significant because it discovers the underlying basis for RSV susceptibility preterm and mechanistic approaches to enhance innate immunity.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal is to explore the potential of a novel class of compounds with a unique mechanism of action different from existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of hepatitis B (HBV). HBV is an infectious agent that infects the liver and causes severe consequences, such as liver failure, fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. All the approved chemotherapeutic treatments (i.e. Lamivudine, Adefovir and Entecavir) only inhibit viral replication by interfering viral DNA synthesis. Resistant variants which develop due to viral DNA polymerase mutation invariably emerge with long-term treatment. Therefore, novel compounds with mechanisms other than the action on viral DNA polymerase, working alone or in combination with current treatments, are needed. A series of derivatives from the natural product, Helioxanthin, were synthesized and discovered to perform a wide-spectrum of antiviral activity by us. Two derivatives, 8-1 and 5-4-2, exhibited potent anti-HBV activity in culture. Unlike the current clinically used anti-HBV drugs that only inhibited HBV DNA synthesis, 8-1 and 5-4-2 inhibit HBV DNA, RNA, and proteins as determined in HBV stably transfected cell lines. HBV resistant to Lamivudine was still sensitive to these compounds. The action of 8-1 and 5-4-2 is different from other anti-HBV drugs and has never been reported. The mechanism of action seems to involve direct alteration of the viral transcription complex. In this application two specific aims are proposed as following: 1. Study of the unique mechanism of the antiviral action of 8-1 and 5-4-2 against HBV. This includes: the mechanism against HBV RNA transcription, potentiation of anti-HBV activity nucleoside drugs, activity against HbeAg- HBV, and uptake and metabolism in HBV infected cells. 2. Evaluation of the in vivo anti-HBV activity of 8-1. Compound 5-4-2 will be the backup compound. A novel HBV transgenic mice will be used to obtain preliminary pharmacokinetic information and toxicity of 8-1 as well as to assess antiviral activity of 8-1. The studies proposed will provide information about not only the potential of the novel compound 8-1, as an anti-HBV drug, but also the roles of liver enriched transcription factors in regulation of HBV transcription.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA viruses, in general, are deadly human pathogens, and highly efficient in evading antivirals and vaccines, due in part to their ability to mutate rapidly. The annual Flu epidemics and the recent emergence of SARS are important reminders. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the major areas of host-virus interaction in the gene expression and signal transduction of negative-strand RNA viruses, using primarily the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as a model. RSV is a severe lung pathogen in children, causing respiratory diseases and asthma, and claiming nearly a million lives globally each year. In the US alone, RSV infection leads to about 100,000 hospitalizations, costing roughly $350 million to the US taxpayers. The immunopathology of RSV also is highly complex, making it difficult to formulate a reliable vaccine or antiviral. We reasoned that a prudent approach to the management of RSV should take into account the host-virus interactive pathways. In the last few years, we have shown that cellular actin is an essential transcription factor for RSV. Our recent studies using phenotypic knockdown of cellular proteins by a relatively novel strategy, known as  RNA interference , have revealed an essential role of 3 cytoskeletal-regulatory proteins (CRPs) in RSV maturation. These proteins are: profilin, VASP, and zyxin. Previous studies demonstrated that these proteins were relatively non-essential for the host cell. Thus, we propose that these CRPs could be potential targets for an antiviral regimen. Moreover, an understanding of their role in RSV morphogenesis would shed light on the fundamental mechanism of how the cytoskeleton may play a critical role in RNA viral maturation. Thus, the Specific Aims of the proposal involve detailed studies of: (i) the role of actin as a viral transcription factor; and (ii) the involvement of the CRPs in viral morphogenesis. The available CRP knockout mice strains will be used to complement and extend these studies to an animal model. Together, these results should lead to a better understanding of the replication of RSV in particular and of RNA viruses in general, and pave the way for a more reliable management of the viral diseases.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amphetamine abuse has severe health consequences. Persistent deficits in CNS function, altered cognition, and comorbid psychiatric conditions are suspected outcomes of long-term amphetamine abuse. The immense costs (medical, legal, societal) associated with any drug of abuse are compounded in the case of methamphetamine (METH) because it causes damage to the nervous system. Research in this project is translational in thrust, and will extend and capitalize on progress made in the study of METH-induced neurotoxicity during the previous funding period. Cellular stress caused by reactive oxygen/nitrogen species has been implicated in METH-induced neurotoxicity, but neither the specific reactant nor its cellular source has been identified. The long-term goal of this proposal is to increase understanding of the biochemical and cellular processes that mediate METH neurotoxicity, with a focus on microglia. Activated microglia produce numerous reactants that cause damage to neuronal tissue. On the other hand, pharmacological stimulation of selected microglial receptors can exert neuroprotective effects by preventing their activation. Therefore, the following specific aims will test the hypotheses that METH-induced microglial activation is a critical element of its neurotoxic cascade, and targeting of receptors on microglia that prevent or reduce their activation will protect against METH neurotoxicity: 1) determine the pharmacological and neurochemical features of METH-induced microglial activation with emphasis on the role of dopamine and its quinone; 2) assess the functional consequences of microglial activation on METH-induced toxicity in cell culture and in vivo model systems- microglial activation will be provoked by the neurotoxic HIV Tat protein (and other activators) to enhance METH neurotoxicity, and neuroprotective receptors on microglia will be targeted by caffeine (adenosine) and estrogen (ERa) to protect against drug-induced neurotoxicity; and 3) delineate the mechanisms by which microglial activation alters the function of critical proteins (i.e., dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase) targeted for damage by METH. Completion of these specific aims will contribute to an increased understanding of the neurotoxicity associated with METH. The results of these studies will also have direct translational application to clinical settings where the comorbid consequences of drug abuse are being manifested with increased frequency. Research in this proposal is especially relevant to AIDS- related neuropathology, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative conditions in which microglial activation contributes to CNS damage.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading respiratory pathogen in infants and young children worldwide. RSV infection does not induce protective immunity and therefore repeated RSV infections occur throughout life. In addition to the considerable morbidity caused by acute RSV infections, numerous studies have described a strong association between RSV bronchiolitis in infancy and abnormal pulmonary function later in life. Exaggeration of the immune response to RSV infection is thought to play a significant role in the development of these long-term pulmonary abnormalities. Despite decades of research, however, our understanding of the immune responses induced by RSV remains limited. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the effect of RSV on the immune system in the context of human dendritic cells (DCs), since these cells are uniquely capable of inducing primary immune responses and thus bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems. The central hypothesis of this project is that RSV skews immune responses toward Type 2 inflammatory responses via targeting plasmacytoid DCs. The studies proposed herein will begin to define the mechanisms involved in the interaction between RSV and DCs and how these interactions influence the establishment of T cell responses. We believe that these studies may ultimately contribute to the development of immunomodulatory strategies aimed at prevention of RSV infection.  The immediate goal of the candidate is to procure further training in basic science investigation to enhance her research skills and allow her to develop a career as an independent investigator. As a career focus, the candidate plans to concentrate on the immunopathogenesis of the host/viral pathogen relationship with an emphasis on the role of DCs in this relationship. To assist in achieving this goal, the research proposal calls for the attainment of new scientific technical and intellectual skills while concurrently investigating a timely research project, the alterations of human dendritic cell subsets by RSV. Both the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the Baylor Institute for Immunology Research provide fertile laboratory environments in terms of available laboratory facilities/equipment and experienced, successful faculty members committed to mentoring the candidate. This award will facilitate the transition of the candidate into an independent, academic physician scientist.',\n",

Dr. Huang is currently an Instructor in Infectious Diseases who has a long-standing interest in bacterial antibiotic resistance and hospital epidemiology. This project will develop and test methods to guide more effective control of nosocomial transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Specifically, it will introduce an alternative monitoring method and assess its ability to identify periods of high MRSA and VRE transmission when compared to current methods, b) evaluate the use of carriage pressure to predict transmission and control for the non-independent (contagious) nature of infectious agents, c) re-evaluate the association of potential predictors of transmission after controlling for carriage pressure, and d) develop and implement an improved monitoring system which warns of high risk potential and activates an intervention to prevent transmission of MRSA and VRE. Methods will include state-change transmission models, observational cohort, case cohort, and prospective cohort designs. Mentors will include experts from the fields of infectious diseases and epidemiology (Richard Platt, M.D., M.S., Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School), and mathematics and infectious diseases transmission modeling (Marc Lipsitch, Ph.D., Harvard School of Public Health). This project will provide foundational knowledge about the validity of regression techniques for non-independent infectious outcomes, and evaluate the impact of an intervention to stem health care associated transmission of MRSA and VRE.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mosquito-borne viruses are of increasing concern in the US and Florida. In 2002, there were over 4000 human cases of West Nile (WN) fever or encephalitis in the US. Other arboviruses such as St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus, Eastern equine encephalitis; and Western equine encephalitis viruses also cause human disease and are of concern. Control and reduction of cases requires a clear understanding of the transmission cycle and factors, which influence transmission, but much of the needed information is lacking.     In Florida, Culex nigripalpus and Cx. quinquefasciatus are considered the most important vectors of WN and SLE viruses. We will study these vector-virus systems using an integrated approach with field, laboratory and theoretical methods. Our focus is on 3 specific aims: 1) to understand the relationship between infection and transmission rates in mosquitoes; 2) to consider the effect of mosquito population age structure on transmission cycles; and 3) to determine the impact of multiple vector species on arbovirus systems.     Field studies will use a modified sentinel chicken protocol and aspirator collections to determine the relative abundance and age structure of several populations of the two Culex species and their infection and transmission rates. Laboratory studies will focus on the effect of temperature, age, and blood meal on infection and transmission rates. Mathematical studies will integrate available information and the results of the laboratory and field studies to investigate the relationship between infection and transmission rates and the effect of age structure and multiple vectors on transmission cycles.     It is critical to use an integrated approach to study arbovirus cycles, as they are complex systems that cannot be understood by considering isolated elements. We will use integrated lab, field and modeling studies to investigate SLE and WN virus cycles in Florida. The results will be applicable to other viruses and other locations, and will provide information on the interpretation of surveillance results, the influence of mosquito age and population age structure on transmission, and the effect of multiple species of vectors involved in the transmission cycles.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The transmission of an infectious agent from one host to another is critical to the success of any pathogen. In the case of HIV, a successful transmission is dependent on the ability of the virus to transverse a mucosal membrane (rectal, penile, vaginal or oral) of a new host and establish a productive infection. This proposal builds on findings we obtained while undertaking a previous grant funded by the NIH (NIDCR) (1999 to 2003) to assess the earliest events following oral transmission of SIV in the macaque model. Oral transmission of HIV represents a major route of transmission from mother to infant, through ingesting the virus during breast-feeding; as well as in adults during oral genital transmission (virus in semen). One major finding from our previous studies was the identification of the oral mucosa, esophagus and tonsils as sites of SIV entry following a nontraumatic oral application of the virus and the assessment of the innate and adaptive immune responses that correlate with the rates of disease progression. Here we expand upon our previous findings by assessing the impact of immune activation on the transmission of SIV administered into the oral cavity. We hypothesize that higher levels of immune activation will increase the potential for SIV to elicit a productive infection when administered to the oral cavity of macaques. These studies will utilize a low dose regimen of viral inoculations to mimic the viral levels that are present in breast milk and semen. The goal of specific aim 1 is to determine the appropriate viral inoculum to undertake aim two, and to investigate the correlates of viral transmission in the absence of any immune modifications. Aim 2 will assess transmission of SIV while the mucosa is experiencing a state of immune activation, gingivitis. Gingivitis is a common inflammation of the oral mucosa in humans and therefore may be impacting oral transmission in humans exposed to HIV containing semen (through receptive oral intercourse). These studies assessing the impact of the immune response on oral transmission will likely be applicable to other sites of mucosal transmission, and will be important for determining the immune mechanisms that impact the success of SIV/HIV mucosal transmission. Our long term goal is to utilize these findings to aid in the design of SIV/HIV vaccines that are able to elicit sterilizing immunity by preventing the infection of the first target cell when mucosal sites are exposed to HIV/SIV.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Effective prevention strategies for HIV are critically needed, and an effective HIV vaccine is the best long-range hope to dramatically reduce the rate of new HIV infections. To this goal, our current understanding of the biology and epidemiology of HIV transmission remains limited. This Program Project will focus on the identification and systematic evaluation of individuals who have been recently infected with HIV and the sexual partners who transmitted HIV to them (Transmission Pairs) to elucidate and quantify epidemiologic, behavioral, biologic, virologic, and host factors that contribute to transmission.       The San Diego Primary Infection research group has a long and successful history of recruiting acutely and very recently HIV-infected individuals and their transmitting partners. With new approaches to expand our identification of such study participants, as described in the Clinical and Specimen Core, we will address in Project 1 (Transmission Probability): (Aim 1) the transmission probability per contact ((J), (Aim 2) the rate of partner change (c), (Aim 3) the duration of infectious stages (D), and thus determine the reproductive number (R0) of HIV in this population. These investigations will be complemented with Project 2 (Transmission Correlates) that will identify and quantify the contributions of important biologic (Aim 1), viral (Aim 2), and host (Aim 3) correlates of HIV sexual transmission. Most importantly, this research will allow for the accurate estimation of a potential prevention strategy or candidate vaccine's anticipated efficacy based on both an estimation of the target populations' ongoing risk behavior and a thorough understanding of viral and host factors that contribute to HIV transmission. The Administrative Core (Core A) will play a central role in coordinating the administrative, fiscal, data, and statistical support for this Project as well as providing scientific support and facilitating synergistic interaction among investigators and collaborators critical to the success of the interactive projects. The Clinical and Specimen Core (Core B) will identify, recruit and enroll study subjects and collect, process, store, and manage the clinical specimens needed to meet the objectives of the two proposed research projects.      PROJECT 1: Transmission Probability  (Strathdee, S.)    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Modeling prevention interventions requires insights into epidemiological and biological factors affecting HIV transmission. Project 1 of the proposed Program Project addresses the epidemiological determinants of HIV transmission by examining the per contact transmission probability (P), the rate of partner change/ contact rate (c), and the duration of infectiousness (D), which all contribute to the reproductive number (R0= pcD), defined as the average number of secondary infections arising from a single infection in a completely susceptible population. To achieve this objective, we will address the following specific aims: Aim 1: Per contact transmission probability (P) - The per contact sexual transmission probability of HIV will be estimated, taking into account stage of HIV infection in the source partner, presence of viral and bacterial sexually transmitted infections, circumcision status, and other biological cofactors investigated in Project 2. The absolute and relative difference of transmission probability for insertive versus receptive anal sex will also be considered. Aim 2: Rate of partner change (c) - The role of partner selection in HIV acquisition and transmission risk will be examined at individual, partnership, and network levels. At the individual level, the relative contribution of HIV risk due to number of sexual acts versus number of sexual partners will be examined. At the partnership level, risk characteristics will be compared between transmitting and seroconcordant non-transmitting partnerships. At the network level, risk of acquisition and transmission of HIV based on the location of individuals within networks of venues used to meet sex partners, and correlates of being in a transmission cluster, will be elucidated. Aim 3: Duration of infectiousness (D) - To determine how duration of the infectious stages of HIV infection intersects with risk behaviors and time to antiretroviral treatment. We will use data from Aims 1-3 to develop a stochastic, individual-based model to predict the number of secondary infections arising from individuals diagnosed during recent HIV infection as they transit to chronic infection, and the potential impact of short-course antiviral therapy on reducing transmission. Project 1 depends on well-characterized clinical data and specimens collected by the Clinical and Specimen Core and the subsequent measurement of transmission correlates in Project 2. Epidemiological data contributing to HIV transmission collected in Project 1 will help to define correlates of HIV transmission in Project 2. The Administrative Core will coordinate administrative, fiscal, data, and statistical support for Projects 1 and 2. These data will provide critical information on epidemiological determinants of HIV transmission in a setting where HIV-1 subtype B predominates, which are lacking for MSM, and will generate important exploratory data for other populations.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excitatory synaptic transmission underlies all cognition, and changes in this transmission are thought to play a role in many neurological disorders. The fast component of excitatory transmission is mainly carried by AMPA-type glutamate receptors. These receptors are tetramers assembled in neuron- specific stoichiometries from four types of subunits (GluR1-4). It has recently been discovered that AMPA receptors in neurons are also associated with auxiliary subunits called TARPs (transmembrane AMPA-R regulatory proteins), a family of four proteins of which stargazin (STG) has been most widely characterized. STG has two distinct effects on AMPA receptors. One is to promote trafficking to the plasma membrane and to anchor AMPA receptors to the synapse via PSD-95. The other one is to modulate the kinetics of AMPA receptors by lowering the EC50 for glutamate and by slowing receptor deactivation and desensitization, effects which have immediate impact on the waveform of synaptic transmission. However, most studies have been carried out by coexpressing STG with GluR1 and 2, and much less is known about STG's effects on other receptor subunits and about the actions of the other three TARPs which are far more prevalent in cortex and hippocampus. We have recently discovered that the receptor subunit GluR3, unlike GluR1 and GluR2, exhibits almost no kinetic modulation by STG. The TARPs gamma-4 and gamma-8, on the other hand, caused a slowing of deactivation and desensitization in GluR3 that was larger than in GluR1 and 2. Interestingly, surface expression of GluR3 was strongly promoted by STG, which indicates (i) that STG did associate with GluR3 and (ii) that modulation of receptor kinetics and trafficking are independently regulated. In this project we will determine how and why the four TARPs differ in their effect on receptor subunits. In Specific Aim 1, we will complete our analysis of their impact on GluR3 and extend our analysis to include GluR2 and GluR4. Moreover, we will examine the effects of the four TARPs on heteromeric subunit combinations that are prevalent in brain. These data will have immediate relevance for understanding the waveform of synaptic transmission in different brain areas. In Specific Aim 2 we will then determine which amino acids in GluR3 are responsible for the differential effects of the TARPs. For this we will systemically exchange segments between GluR2 and GluR3, starting with the S1-S2 domain thought to be central, and then use point mutations to identify the critical amino acids. These experiments should allow us to identify the contact points between AMPA receptor subunits and TARPs that are important for kinetic modulation. Recent evidence suggests that both GluR and TARP expression is altered in disorders such as schizophrenia. Thus, the results of this study will be relevant also to understand aberrations in excitatory transmission that are thought to underlie many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Much evidence suggests that disturbances in excitatory synaptic transmission contribute to the pathogenesis of various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Such disturbances in synaptic transmission may arise from changes in AMPA-type glutamate receptors, but recent studies have found that proteins associated with AMPA receptors may similarly contribute to pathology. For instance, proteins called TARPs which modulate AMPA receptor function have been shown to be altered in the brains of schizophrenic patients. In this project we will study the impact of TARPs on different types of AMPA receptors. Given that AMPA receptors vary across neurons, the results from these studies are expected to offer new explanations as to why synaptic transmission varies in different parts of the brain, and they may also provide new insights about aberrations in excitatory transmission in various brain disorders.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is readily transmitted by inhalation of aerosolized mycobacteria. As T cell immunity develops, growth of MTB is controlled. Despite robust activation of innate and adaptive immunity, however, MTB resists and evades these responses to survive and persist. MTB blocks the effects of oxygen radicals, modulates the phagosome in the macrophage to its advantage by inhibiting acidification and fusion with lysosomes. CD4+ T cells are central to adaptive immunity to MTB and MTB modulates CD4+ T cell responses. First, prolonged TLR-2 stimulation by mycobacterial lipoproteins inhibits MHC-II antigen processing by macrophages for CD4+ T cells. Second, MTB phosphotidyl-inositol mannoside (PIM) interacts with VLA-5 (Valpha5beta1) on CD4+ T cells and induces adhesion to fibronectin. Third, the MTB cell wall contains additional molecule(s) that affect IFN-gamma signaling and CD4+ T cell co-stimulation. Thus the interaction between MTB and T cells is determined by the balance between the host's ability to optimally activate T cells, and MTB's ability to inhibit or deviate T cell recognition and effector function. This model generates the following testable hypotheses: First, MTB uses multiple molecular mechanisms to directly and indirectly (i.e. through the ARC) modulate CD4+ T cell responses to mycobacterial proteins. Second, MTB uses distinct host receptors (e.g. TLR-2, IFN-gammaR, VLA-5) to modulate these T cell responses. Third, differential sensitivity to MTB mediated modulation of ARC and T cell function allows T cell subsets to complement each other. The aims to test these hypotheses are: 1. To determine the cellular events associated with VLA-5 dependent PIM-induced human CD4+ T cell migration and adhesion to fibronectin (FN), and to compare different PIM families and species in their ability to induce CD4+ T cell adhesion and migration; 2. To determine the identity and mechanism of a novel MTB molecule that co-stimulates human memory CD4+ T cells in the presence of extracellular matrix protein, FN; 3.To determine if human T cell subsets ( CD4, CDS, gammadelta Tregs) differ in sensitivity to molecules MTB, such as PIM and the co-stimulator of Aim 2, that modulate memory CD4+ T cells. These studies will provide insight into how MTB can regulate T cell responses to mycobacterial antigens.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The design of effective country-wide Chagas disease control programs depend on the understanding of the different factors that play a role in the maintenance and transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi. A clear comprehension of the transmission dynamics of this parasite and its relationship to its vector and reservoir species is crucial for the design of control measures aimed at stopping transmission to humans. The predominant T. cruzi vector species in Northern South America occupy both sylvatic and domestic habitats. As sylvatic vectors become domiciliated, blood sources in the peridomestic environment serve as a bridge between the sylvatic and domestic cycles of transmission. Interaction between sylvatic and synanthropic vectors and mammalian reservoirs favors the constant exchange of parasite strains and their transmission to humans. We hypothesize that the T. cruzi II (TCII) lineage will predominate in domestic habitats, and the TCI lineage will become more prevalent as habitats move from domestic to peridomestic to sylvatic habitats. In addition, we also hypothesize that there is high genetic similarity among parasites isolated from different hosts collected in the domestic, peridomestic and sylvatic habitats in Southern Ecuador, indicating frequent parasite exchange. We will test these hypotheses by: (1) molecularly characterizing T. cruzi isolates from different hosts at domestic, peridomestic and sylvatic environments in Southern Ecuador and (2) determining their genetic similarity; (3) Finally, in order to understand the biotic and abiotic factors that influence gene flow between parasite populations, we propose to examine the relationship between genetic distance and geographical distance. To accomplish these aims we will collect triatomines, mammalian reservoirs and human blood in a set of rural communities located in different ecological zones within Loja Province, in Southern Ecuador. We will isolate and molecularly characterize T. cruzi from these sources using PCR amplification of the non-transcribed spacer regions of the mini-exon gene, 24Sa rRNA and 18Sa rRNA. In addition we will determine the genetic flow among parasite populations infecting the different hosts by analyzing up to 11 polymorphic microsatellites loci in conjunction with the construction of phylogenetic trees. Finally, we will use geostatistical techniques to examine the relationship between the genetic and spatial distances of the various T. cruzi isolates. In addition to helping understand the transmission cycles of T. cruzi, this project will provide excellent training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and medical students while fortifying the PI's research program and strengthening the institutional research environment, thereby fulfilling the goals of Academic Research Enhancement Award (AREA). The results of this project will add to the existing basic biological knowledge base and contribute towards the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' (NIAID) mission of understanding and preventing infectious diseases and thus, improving the health of millions of people in the United States and around the world. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi threatens 100 million people in Latin America, and constitutes a major cause of heart disease in this region. The proposed project will examine the transmission cycles of this parasite Southern Ecuador, which is representative of a vast region of South America where the biological factors affecting T. cruzi transmission have been scarcely studied in the past. The proposed research will expand the knowledge regarding the biology of T. cruzi transmission in the Andean region, which is paramount for the establishment of control programs aimed at stopping transmission of the parasite to human populations.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders affecting humans and animals. Although rare, the recent outbreak of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy(BSE) in cattle and Chronic Wasting disease (CWD) in cervids and the transmission of the disease from cattle to humans have caused great concern. This problem is aggravated by the lack of an efficient, sensitive and early diagnosis as well as many uncertainties surrounding the unprecedented nature of the infectious agent, its mechanism of propagation and the species-barrier that controls prion transmission. The major goals of this Program Project are to understand the mechanism of transmission and pathogenesis of BSE and CWD prions, to estimate the risk of these infectious agents to propagate disease to other animals and especially to humans, to assess the mechanisms and routes of prion dissemination among animals and to develop novel strategies for ante-mortem detection of infected animals. A team of accomplished scientists with widely recognized expertise and track record of contributions in this field will work collaboratively to reach these goals. Project 1 (Juergen Richt, PL) proposes to study in detail mutant and knock out cows and assess the role of genetic forms of BSE in disease transmission, susceptibility and species barrier. For these studies, we plan to generate and characterize knock in transgenic cattle expressing a PrP mutation recently identified in a natural BSE case in USA. We will also use transgenic mice models expressing wild type and mutant bovine PrP and in vitro studies of PrP replication using the PMCA. Project 2 (Glenn Telling, PL) proposes to generate and use transgenic mice models to assess the strength of various species barriers and the influence of prion strains. We will study the susceptibility of various models to be infected by CWD as well as the possibility that deer models may be infected by prions from other species. To address this aim, experiments will be done in transgenic mice models and using in vitro conversion studies. Project 3 (Claudio Soto, PL) proposes to study the replication of CWD and BSE prions in vitro, evaluate tissue distributions of infectious protein, enlighten the routes of transmission and develop a diagnostic assay. For this purpose, we will use the PMCA technology, recently developed in Dr Soto's lab to mimic the prion replication process. The Administration Core (core A) (Claudio Soto, Director) will facilitate and integrate Projects and Cores and take care of all administrative aspects needed for the smooth operation of the Program. The Tissue Core (core B) (Pierluigi Gambetti, Director) will process, analyze and store the tissue samples generated and provide access to the members to a biosafety facility to manipulate BSE infectious material. The findings generated in this Program will have undoubtedly contribute to understand the pathogenesis, route of propagation and early detection of these two worrisome zoonotic prion diseases.     PROJECT 1: Pathogenesis, Transmission and Genetic forms of BSE  (Richt, J.)    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prion diseases or Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) are a group of infectious neurodegenerative disorders affecting humans and animals. Although rare diseases, the fact that Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) is present in North America and the continuous spread of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), have augmented concerns about a possible problem for human health. This research project builds around three important recent findings from my laboratory: 1.) The discovery of unusual BSE cases in the U.S. cattle population. 2.) The discovery of the first and so far only case of a genetic form (E211K) of an animal TSE in the 2006 U.S. BSE case. 3.) The generation of PrP knock-out cattle that develop healthy up to an adult stage. These three findings provide us with unique tools to investigate several aspects of BSE pathogenesis. The major goal of this project is to generate and characterize mutant knock-in and knock-out cows and assess disease transmission, susceptibility and species barrier in diverse forms of BSE using transgenic mice and in vitro conversion experiments. In specific aim 1 we plan to characterize PrP knock-out cattle in more detail and generate and characterize PrP knock-in cattle expressing the mutation E211K in the PrP null background. In specific aim 2 we will study the susceptibility of PrP bovinized mice expressing the E211K mutation to various forms of BSE. Specific aim 3 will evaluate transmission of E211K bovine prions and other BSE isolates to transgenic mice expressing PrP from various animal species, including sheep, deer, and human as well as wild type mice and hamsters. In specific aim 4 we plan to evaluate the differential susceptibility of PrPc from various species (human, sheep, cattle and deer) to be converted in vitro by PrPsc derived from various forms of BSE. The findings obtained in this project will provide a substantial advance on our understanding of BSE pathogenesis, transmission and species barrier and will likely have great impact in public health and the regulatory measures to prevent further spreading of this disease.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plasmodium vivax malaria, a leading health problem throughout the Amazon basin on Latin America, is endemic in the Peruvian Amazon. The long-term goal of this project is to determine specific epidemiological characteristics of P. vivax transmission and human reservoirs of maintaining P. vivax transmission in the Peruvian Amazon region towards the rational deployment of a transmission-blocking vaccine. This project will test the hypothesis that reproduction of exogenous P. vivax into local populations is responsible for continuing transmission in rural villages surrounding Iquitos, Peru, the capital of the Peruvian Amazon. Alternative hypotheses are 1) that relapsing P. vivax malaria is the source for maintaining local transmission; or 2) there is simply continuous transmission of already locally established genotypes within local populations. Specific aim 1 is to determine circulating Plasmodium vivax genotypes at the individual village level through prospective, population-based surveillance of people with P. vivax parasitemia. Changes or stability of P. vivax genotypes will be assessed over space and time using recently validated genetic markers. Specific aim 2 is to determine transmission dynamics of P. vivax using geographic spatio- temporal analysis of circulating genotypes using spatial statistical modeling and cluster analysis. These analyses will distinguish whether circulating P. vivax genotypes are already established in villages (either continuously circulating or resulting from relapsing P. vivax from hypnozoites) or are newly introduced by infected inhabitants returning from travel away from the village. Specific aim 3 is to determine whether transmission-blocking immunity develops in the Peruvian Amazon population to potentially modify P. vivax transmission dynamics. Membrane feeding studies will be performed using local Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes and local P. vivax patients as sources of parasites, and by experimental infections of Anopheles mosquitoes from splenectomized non-human primates infected experimentally with P. vivax. In vitro assays (ELISA, IFA) will be used to determine the validity of the in vivo mosquito infection assay. These data will provide the basis for planning transmission-blocking interventions and elimination of human reservoirs of P. vivax, and provide a rational basis for determining strategies to implement and deploy new transmission- blocking vaccines as one approach towards the future elimination of P. vivax malaria from the Amazon basin.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The longer term goal of the research is aimed at finding new ways to prevent or to treat the infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In order to reach such goal, it is required to study the molecular aspects by which the virus enter to the cell, and how the RSV could take advantage of this to modulate the immune response. RSV has been proposed to fuse its envelope directly with the cell membrane; however, cell membrane is not a homogeneous place and that it is constituted by different microdomains such as lipid rafts. The current proposal would help clarify the role that lipid rafts are playing during the viral penetration and the mechanistic aspects involved for allowing the lipid raft to participate. Since lipid rafts cluster very important signaling molecules involved in both innate and adaptive immunity, this proposal would also test the hypothesis that RSV proteins target lipid rafts to modulate the immune response. The specific aims of this project are: 1) To determine whether lipid raft trafficking constitutes a very important pathway for RSV to infect normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells. To address this aim, lipid rafts will be disrupted by taking away the free membrane cholesterol and RSV infection will be examined in such context. The RSV envelope protein targeting the lipid raft will be examined by evaluating whether RSV-deficient/delta for G and/or SH use lipid rafts to infect NHBE cells. 2) Determine which signaling pathway is involved in assembly of lipid rafts triggered by RSV infection. The role of PKC-alpha, calcium, PI-PLC, and dynamin-2 in the lipid raft clustering triggered by RSV will be examined using pharmacological inhibitors, and dominant negative constructs. 3) Determine whether RSV targets lipid rafts in order to modulate the immune response. NHBE cells transfected with plasmids encoding both EGFP and secreted G (sG) protein will be co-cultured with non-transfected NHBE cells. ERK-1/2 and STAT-1 signaling will be examined using EMSA and anti-phospho-specific antibodies for western-blots and immunocytofluorescence. The effect of the potential presence of RSV proteins in the immunological synapse on the dendritic cell side will be examined by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. In Colombia, RSV is the most important respiratory pathogen agent causing 41.8% of the new cases of lower tract respiratory illness in infants. Understanding the mechanistic process of the RSV infection will help in the development of the vaccines and therapies.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease (LSD) caused by a deficiency in palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1) activity. This leads to the accumulation of autofluorescent material in enurons and glia of the brain. The first clinical sign of INCL is visual dysfunction followed by cognitive deficits, seizures and premature death. The PPT1-deficient mouse is a powerful tool to uncover the mechanisms of disease and test novel therapeutic approaches for INCL. During the initial funding period of this grant we made significant progress in understanding the underlying pathophysiology of INCL. However, there is still much to be understood regarding the underlying mechanisms of disease. Currently, there is no effective therapy for INCL and traditional approaches such as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are only minimally effective for rapidly progressing LSDs with profound CNS components. Successful treatment of INCL will require the development of new and innovative approaches. We showed that significant reductions in the accumulation of autofluorescent storage material, and improvments in behavior and seizure phenotype can be achieved following AAV- mediated, CNS-directed gene therapy. Although statistically significant, these improvments were modest. This is in contrast to other models of LSD that respond more completely to CNS-directed gene therapy. These data highlight the differences between LSDs and the need to develop more effective therapies for eac of these disorders, The goals of this research are to more completely understand the mechanisms of disease and devise more effective therapies approaches for INCL. We will accoumplish these goals with the following Specific Aims: 1) We will complete the biochemical, histological and physiological characterization of the PPT1-deficient mouse on the congenic C57BI/6 background. 2) We will determine the individual contributions of astrocytes and neurons to the progression of INCL i the congenic murine model of INCL. 3) We will determine the efficacy of CNS-directed AAV2/5-mediated gene therapy alone, and in combination with bone marrow transplantation or small molecule substrate depletion in the congenic PPT1-deficient mouse.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of respiratory infection in infants and is a significant cause of disease in immunocompromised patients and the elderly. In addition, RSV is closely related to other highly pathogenic viruses, such as Ebola and Nipah, and is a good model for studying their molecular biology. RSV has an RNA genome that is transcribed and replicated by the virus polymerase to produce mRNA and progeny genomes. The focus of this project is the characterization of the interaction of the RSV polymerase complex with its promoter in the RSV genome. This will be achieved by addressing three major aims. (1) The region of the RSV polymerase that interacts with its binding site in the promoter will be identified using surface residue modification and UV cross-linking techniques. Identification of the interacting site will be confirmed by reverse-genetics, using a minigenome assay that allows analysis of RSV transcription and replication in an intracellular environment. (2) The mechanism of encapsidation initiation, necessary for the elongation stage of RNA replication will be examined. Mutations will be made in the encapsidation signal in the full-length clone of RSV and a forward-genetics approach will be applied to identify which virus protein, and which region within that protein, it might interact with. (3) Virus and cellular proteins that interact with the polymerase complex will be identified using immunoprecipitation of polymerase complexes, mass spectrometry, and Western blotting. The roles of associated cellular proteins during different stages of RSV RNA synthesis will be determined by inhibiting their expression and examining RSV RNA synthesis in the minigenome system and RSV infected cells. The effects of promoter mutations that are known to differentially modulate transcription and replication will be investigated to determine if they affect the composition of the polymerase complex that binds the promoter. This research will provide information regarding the composition and regulation of a protein-RNA complex that plays a key role in RSV multiplication. In the long-term, this work will allow detailed structural analysis of this complex to be performed, which could aid in design of inhibitors to control RSV infection, and could identify mutations that could be made in the virus genome to generate a live- attenuated RSV vaccine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major human pathogen, responsible for significant numbers of pediatric hospitalizations and for seasonal disease in the elderly. The aim of this project is to progress our molecular understanding of a critical step in the virus multiplication cycle, with the long-term goal of developing antiviral drugs and vaccines to control RSV disease.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the late 1980s, a series of Plasmodium falciparum malaria epidemics have occurred in the highlands of African countries. The current pattern of malaria in the highlands exhibits the characteristics of an expanded geographic area, increased frequency, and increased fatality rates. What has caused the more frequent and more widespread malaria epidemics since the late 1980s in African highlands? Can we forecast when and where an epidemic will occur so that appropriate actions can be taken in advance to reduce morbidity and mortality? How can we maximize the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of vector control to reduce malaria transmission and incidence in the highlands? These questions are not only of scientific interest, but they are also of paramount importance for malaria control. The long-term objectives of this research are to determine the mechanisms of malaria epidemics in African highlands, and to develop efficient vector control methods for epidemic malaria control. In the previous period of support, we made significant progress elucidating the effects of land use and land cover on malaria transmission in African highlands. We proposed the climate- landscape hypothesis as a leading mechanism for the emergence of epidemic malaria in African highlands. This competing renewal application will test the climate-landscape hypothesis using epidemiological, entomological, and molecular population genetics data in western Kenya highlands. The project will use community-based longitudinal cohort studies as a central platform for the following three inter-related specific aims. First, we will develop models for malaria dynamics and epidemics forecasting in the highlands and determine the accuracy and sensitivity of the models using prospective climate and malaria incidence data. Second, we will determine the effects of landscape factors on the spread of malaria infections and identify transmission hotspots for targeted malaria vector control. Third, we will assess the impact of mosquito vector control targeted at transmission hotspots on rates of malaria transmission, infection incidence, and clinical malaria occurrence. This project will achieve the following goals: a) reveal critical parameters needed for the development of malaria early warning systems in African highlands, b) significantly enhance our understanding of the relationships between climate, landscape, and the transmission dynamics of malaria, and c) facilitate the development of cost-effective malaria vector control methods. We anticipate that our results will have broad applicability to malaria prevention and control in Africa. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE In Africa highlands, malaria transmission is unstable, and epidemic malaria poses a serious public health problem. It was estimated that epidemic malaria kills about 110,000 people each year and 110 million people are at risk. Understanding the mechanisms leading to malaria epidemics in the highlands will facilitate the development of malaria early warning system so that timely preparedness and preventative measures can be implemented. We hypothesize that mosquito vector control by targeting the malaria transmission hotspots is a cost-effective approach for malaria control in the highlands. This application will combine epidemiological, molecular population genetic and modeling approaches with an interventional analysis to determine the mechanisms causing malaria epidemics and to develop cost-effective vector control methods in western Kenya highlands. Unique to this application is that we will collaborate with scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research to incorporate seasonal climate forecasting into our model, thus we can test the sensitivity and reliability of our model in a real-time manner. We will then determine the effects of targeted vector control on both mosquito larvae and adults in transmission hotspots on malaria incidences. This project will reveal critical parameters needed for the development of malaria early warning system, and will develop novel and cost-effective vector control methods for reducing malaria incidence and preventing malaria epidemics.',\n",

The Clinical and Specimen Core will identify study subjects and provide the blood andgenital secretion specimens for the research projects. Project 1 (Transmission Probability) will ascertainrates of transmission and generate epidemiological and behavioral data. The Administrative Core willcoordinate these activities together with data management, and provide the statistical and analyticalresources to permit robust and valid conclusions regarding the data.Aim 1 of Project 2 will measure the biologic correlates of sexual transmission of HIV. These include viralloads in blood and the genital tract, lymphocyte numbers in genital secretions, and the presence of viral andbacterial sexually transmitted infections. This aim will also address whether sexually transmitted HIVinfection is mediated by cell-free virus or by virus-infected lymphocytes.Aim 2 will assess the viral correlates of sexual transmission of HIV. Extensive nucleotide sequencingwill extend our published observations characterizing virus in the genital compartment. The objective will beto characterize the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of transmitted HIV-1 variants.Aim 3 will investigate host determinants of sexual transmission of HIV. We will extend our studies of theneutralizing antibody response to HIV infection by determining the role of neutralizing antibody in blood andthe genital tract in selecting for transmitted viral variants. The other two components of the aim will leverageour well characterized study subjects and their clinical specimens with two internationally recognizedlaboratories with longstanding collaborations with our group. Dr. Sunil Ahuja from the University of TexasHealth Sciences Center will characterize the host genetics of both index subjects and their transmittingpartners. Drs. Walker, Allen, and Altfeld from Harvard Medical School will provide full length HIV genomesequencing, viral phenotype, and CTL analyses that will characterize the role of cell mediated immunity,escape, and fitness.Each of these Aims is designed to address specific hypotheses. The data collected in Project 2,together with the epidemiologic and behavioral data from Project 1, will permit comprehensive analyses todetermine which parameters are confounding, dependent, or independent determinants of HIV sexualtransmission. These insights should provide important leads into the design of better vaccine candidatesand other preventive strategies.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prion diseases are inevitably fatal, transmissible disorders inducing a progressive neurologic dysfunction after a prolonged incubation period. Oral transmission is the primary route of infection for BSE, scrapie and TME and is the suspected route of transmission for vCJD and CWD. TSEs share several hallmark characteristics including the accumulation of a disease-specific structurally abnormal form of the prion protein (PrPSc). We have recently demonstrated that prions bind to soil, clay minerals and silicon dioxide (Johnson et al., 2007). We have analyzed the binding of PrPSc to montmorillonite clay (Mte) and found it to be extremely avid. When laboratory animals are orally challenged with PrPSc bound to Mte, more animals succumbed to disease with shorter incubation periods than were observed with just PrPSc. Survival analysis of oral transmission experiments demonstrate that prions bound to clay are approximately 700 times more orally transmissible than unbound agent (Johnson et al., 2007). Whole soils have a similar effect; two of three tested soils enhance transmission and the third is no less infectious than unbound PrPSc (Johnson et al., 2007). Our studies support the hypothesis that soil and soil microparticles bind to prion protein (PrPSc) enhancing disease transmission for scrapie and CWD. In this application, we propose to examine the effect of soil microparticles on CWD transmission in deer (SA1). These studies will emphasize whole soils, their ability to bind CWD agent and the impact of this interaction on CWD disease transmission. In SA2, we will determine the mechanism(s) by which clay-bound prions have increased orally transmissible by examining the resistance to degradation, uptake of clay-bound agent and the aggregation state and other biophysical parameters of PrPSc bound to clay. Microparticles are found in many other substances than soil. Meat and bone meal (MBM), a commonly used cattle food supplement thought responsible for BSE in Europe. We present data demonstrating MBM is rich in microparticles and will test if MBM-associated agent enhances oral transmissibility similar to Mte. Finally we will determine if endogenous calcium (Ca) phosphate microparticles, formed in the intestine, promote TSE infection. These studies will assess the infectivity of TSE agent sorbed to Ca phosphate and examining oral infectivity in animals with reduced Ca content. We hypothesize that animals with reduced Ca phosphate microparticles will be less susceptible to TSE infection and that agent sorption to intestinal calcium phosphate represents a step in the pathway by which oral TSE infections in initiated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prion diseases are transmissible neurologic disorders that can affect animals (sheep scrapie, cervid chronic wasting disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and humans (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Kuru). The potential for the environment to maintain and become a source of infectivity for sheep scrapie and cervid CWD is well documented and, undoubtedly, involves oral transmission of low levels of infectious agent. Since oral transmission is, in general, not an efficient means of infecting susceptible animals, we hypothesize a role for soil in the enhancement of oral transmission. Our studies support the hypothesis that soil and soil microparticles bind to prion protein (PrPSc) enhancing disease transmission for scrapie and CWD.',\n",
       " 'Modeling prevention interventions requires insights into epidemiological and biological factors affecting HIVtransmission. Project 1 of the proposed Program Project addresses the epidemiological determinants of HIVtransmission by examining the per contact transmission probability (P), the rate of partner change/ contactrate (c), and the duration of infectiousness (D), which all contribute to the reproductive number (R0= pcD),defined as the average number of secondary infections arising from a single infection in a completelysusceptible population. To achieve this objective, we will address the following specific aims: Aim 1: Percontact transmission probability (P) - The per contact sexual transmission probability of HIV will beestimated, taking into account stage of HIV infection in the source partner, presence of viral and bacterialsexually transmitted infections, circumcision status, and other biological cofactors investigated in Project 2.The absolute and relative difference of transmission probability for insertive versus receptive anal sex willalso be considered. Aim 2: Rate of partner change (c) - The role of partner selection in HIV acquisition andtransmission risk will be examined at individual, partnership, and network levels. At the individual level, therelative contribution of HIV risk due to number of sexual acts versus number of sexual partners will beexamined. At the partnership level, risk characteristics will be compared between transmitting andseroconcordant non-transmitting partnerships. At the network level, risk of acquisition and transmission ofHIV based on the location of individuals within networks of venues used to meet sex partners, andcorrelates of being in a transmission cluster, will be elucidated. Aim 3: Duration of infectiousness (D) - Todetermine how duration of the infectious stages of HIV infection intersects with risk behaviors and time toantiretroviral treatment. We will use data from Aims 1-3 to develop a stochastic, individual-based model topredict the number of secondary infections arising from individuals diagnosed during recent HIV infection asthey transit to chronic infection, and the potential impact of short-course antiviral therapy on reducingtransmission. Project 1 depends on well-characterized clinical data and specimens collected by the Clinicaland Specimen Core and the subsequent measurement of transmission correlates in Project 2.Epidemiological data contributing to HIV transmission collected in Project 1 will help to define correlates ofHIV transmission in Project 2. The Administrative Core will coordinate administrative, fiscal, data, andstatistical support for Projects 1 and 2. These data will provide critical information on epidemiologicaldeterminants of HIV transmission in a setting where HIV-1 subtype B predominates, which are lacking forMSM, and will generate important exploratory data for other populations.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) causes severe disease in the elderly. The pathogenesis of severe disease in the elderly is probably multi-factorial but the dysregulation of the aging immune response is central to understanding disease severity. Unlike other viruses, RSV has evidence of typel and type2 responses. Typel responses include IFNg and IL-12 which are important in viral clearance. Type2 responses include IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 secretion and are important in anti-parasitic responses, allergy and vigorous antibody production. We recently demonstrate that RSV-specific IL-5 (type2) responses during active infection correlate with symptom severity in young and middle-aged adults. We believe that RSV-IL-5 responses will play an important role in RSV disease severity in the elderly. RSV-specific antibody responses to infection are increased compared to young adults. We propose to study the role as well as the potential links between type2 cytokines and vigorous antibody responses in the elderly during RSV infection. The goal of our studies is to provide insights in prevention and treatment of severe RSV disease in the elderly.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most animals have the ability to selectively attend to some stimuli while others are ignored. Mechanisms that endow organisms with this capability are of much general interest since malfunctions in these processes induce debilitating pathologies manifested in a variety of circumstances, e.g., when cognitive function is disrupted by aging, in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders (AD/HD), and when hallucinations associated with schizophrenia are observed. My laboratory studies processes that regulate afferent transmission in the context of motor control. An advantage of this approach is that we are able to directly assess functional consequences of alterations in the efficacy of sensori-motor transmission (evoked movements can be monitored). Specifically, we study a situation where afferent activation will induce a motor response if it occurs during one phase of a motor program, but it will not evoke a response if it occurs during the antagonistic phase. The general goal of our research is to characterize cellular/molecular processes responsible for this type of phasic control. Proposed work will focus on a form of synaptic plasticity that has recently been identified in several loci in the brain. When this plasticity is present, synaptic transmission is a graded function of the baseline membrane potential (i.e., the membrane potential prior to and during afferent activation and spike initiation). As neurons are depolarized, the amount of transmitter that is released per action potential is increased. Proposed experiments will characterize mechanisms that mediate this interesting, but relatively poorly understood type of plasticity. Additionally, we will test a hypothesis that postulates that it can play an important role in regulating sensori-motor transmission during a motor program. Thus during motor programs sensory neurons in our system are rhythmically depolarized via input from central pattern interneurons. We suggest that under normal conditions this input is needed to up-regulate synaptic transmission to make it functional. Consequently, ongoing activity is not easily disrupted. Under more extreme conditions, very strong peripheral activation may induce functional sensori-motor transmission, but a disruption of ongoing activity is more likely to be beneficial under these circumstances.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Disruptions in synaptic transmission underlie the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease patients, namely memory and cognitive deficits. Both neuronal cell death and synaptic dysfunction, independent of cell death, appear to be responsible for these deficits. Amyloid-p (A3) peptide, the primary constituent of neuritic plaques, has been shown to depress synaptic transmission in several models of disease. The objective of this application is to determine the precise types and conformations of A¿ that mediate these alterations in neurotransmission, as well as mechanisms by which they act. Specific conformations of naturally-produced A¿ will be isolated from cell lines, as well as from human AD brain tissue since this most closely mimics the types of A¿ that are present within the disease state. The rationale for this proposal is that an understanding of how A¿ contributes to neuronal dysfunction could lead to identification of better ways to diagnose the disease, as well as lead to potential targets for therapeutic intervention. In preliminary data, we demonstrate that A¿ can alter synaptic transmission, likely through both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. We also show that synaptic activity can regulate release of A¿ from neurons into the extracellular space. Together, this suggests that synaptically-released A¿ may feedback to depress neuronal function. We propose to study the effect and mechanisms of A¿ on synaptic activity using electrophysiology and live-cell imaging in primary neuronal cultures and acute brain slices, as well as a limited series of studies in vivo. The proposed training in electrophysiology and imaging will greatly enhance the career development of the applicant, allowing him to study synaptic transmission from many perspectives. Importantly, the scientific and technical expertise gained in the course of these studies will allow the candidate to attain his long-term goal of establishing an independent research career in neuroscience. Short description. Disruptions in synaptic transmission underlie many of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease patients. This proposal will determine how naturally-produced A¿, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and progression, affects synaptic transmission. Understanding the causes of synaptic dysfunction may provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment of the disease.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests partial support for an international meeting on Synaptic Transmission, which will be held in the framework of the Gordon Research Conferences, from July 27th - August 1st, 2008, in Biddeford (Maine, US). The long-term goal of the Conference is to further our understanding of fundamental molecular and functional mechanisms during synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. Research in this area is driven by the appreciation that an understanding of fundamental mechanisms in Synaptic transmission will be critical for a future understanding of the role(s), and the possible dysfunctions of synaptic transmission in various neurological disease states. The specific aim of this meeting will be to bring together 35 invited scientists (speakers and discussion leaders), with a broad participation of about hundred further junior (graduate students and post-docs), and senior researchers in the field of Synaptic Transmission. The Gordon Research Conference on Synaptic Transmission has been regularly held in a bi-annual meeting cycle since 1998, and the meeting is recognized as an important regularly held meeting in this highly active research area. The unique framework of the Gordon Research Conferences, with ample time for critical discussion of new approaches, and ample opportunities for informal discussions, is an ideal meeting venue to guarantee the goals of this Conference. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Chemical synaptic transmission is the main means of information transfer between nerve cells in the brains of all animals, and humans. As such, synaptic transmission underlies almost every aspect of brain function, like sensory perception in hearing, seeing and smelling, movement execution and motor coordination as well as learning, memory and higher cognitive functions. The health relatedness of this application lies in the appreciation that a thorough understanding of the fundamental molecular and functional mechanisms in Synaptic transmission will greatly contribute to understand the causes of brain diseases like neurodegenerative disorders, mental illness, drug addiction, developmental disorders, and epilepsy and stroke.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading viral cause of lower respiratory illness and hospitalization in young children and has long been recognized as a priority disease for a vaccine. RSV presents many challenges for vaccine efficacy. Over the nearly 40 years since the failed formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine great strides have been made in understanding the appropriate immune responses for protection versus immunopotentiation. Vaccine-evoked protection against RSV-induced disease of the lower respiratory system must include antibody and CD8+ cytolytic T- cells. Of equal or greater importance, the vaccine must not stimulate interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5, indicators of a TH2 CD4+ response. IL-4 has been shown to immunopotentiate while the TH1-associated cytokine interferon-gamma and CD8+ T-cells have been correlated with protection without enhanced lung pathology. Thus, we propose that vaccination will be effective if there is induction of balanced helper and killer T-cell responses to a key RSV antigen. Adenovirus vectors (advectors) have shown promise as vaccines for infectious diseases. Preclinical and clinical testing of replication-defective advector vaccines with potent expression of the encoded antigen is underway for HIV,  Ebola, Influenza, and other diseases. Advectors are capable of stimulating Th1 helper and cytolytic CD8+ responses and neutralizing antibody to the vectored antigen. The overall goal of this SBIR application is to test whether immunization with novel advector vaccine candidates for RSV stimulate neutralizing antibody and virus-specific Th1 CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells without Th2 CD4+. We will build novel recombinant adenovirus vectors that express the RSV F protein to high levels. GenVec has cell lines to construct advectors based on different serotypes of adenovirus, which provides advectors that can be used in prime-boost regimens and circumvent pre-existing anti-vector immunity. These same cell lines facilitate the construction of advectors that express transgenes that are cytotoxic or inhibit advector replication. Additionally, GenVec's cell line has been used as the cell substrate for the generation and manufacturing of an advector-based HIV vaccine that is now in phase II clinical testing. The advectors will be tested for the pattern of immune response evoked to RSV, for efficacy against RSV challenge, and for lung histopathology. Both cotton rat and murine models will be used to fully characterize RSV protection, safety, and the immune response. From the phase I portion of this proposal key immunological and safety data will be generated to enable decision-making for advancement to phase II. In the phase II portion, lead adenovectors will be chosen for additional preclinical efficacy testing, preclinical safety testing, and manufacturing in preparation for clinical  testing.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading viral cause of lower respiratory illness and hospitalization in young children and has long been recognized as a priority disease for a vaccine. We propose a method of vaccination that will induce an antibody and balanced helper and killer T-cell response against RSV without causing enhanced disease. In phase I we will generate novel replication-deficient adenovirus vectors that express F protein and test them for safety, generation of appropriate immune responses, and protection against RSV.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised application seeks funds to conduct the first large scale, prospective assessment of the interqenerational transmission of neglect and abuse (G1->G2->G3), using substantiated cases of childhood neglect and abuse and a comparison group (matched on the basis of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and approximate family social class) who have been followed up into adulthood. Under the Neglect RFA (RFA-OD-99-006), we are currently conducting a  Thirty-Year Follow-Up of Neglected Children  (HD40774), assessing medical and health status, economic consequences, service utilization patterns (past and current), recollections of childhood neglect, and environmental toxins in the home. As a competing continuation, this application maintains its focus on the consequences of childhood neglect and now proposes to follow the children of the original participants. Little prospective evidence of the intergenerational transmission of physical abuse exists and even less is known about the transmission of childhood neglect. Using data already collected during previous waves of the study and during the initial NICHD funding period, we propose to collect new information to address complex questions surrounding the intergenerational transmission of neglect and abuse. We define the G1 generation as parents and non-parent perpetrators of neglect and/or abuse toward the G2 individuals we have been studying since 1986. Thus, we hope to determine if G2 individuals who were neglected or abused in childhood in turn will continue the cycle of maltreatment toward their G3 offspring (G1->G2->G3). We focus primarily on G2's behavior toward biological G3 offspring, but we include non-biological G3 children as well. We also include G2 individuals without children in order not to over- or under-estimate the extent of transmission. There are five broad goals: (1) to test the hypothesis that there is an intergenerational transmission of neglect and abuse; (2) to examine potential mechanisms in the intergenerational transmission of childhood neglect and abuse and to determine whether these mechanisms differ for the transmission of neglect as compared to abuse; (3) to assess whether certain G3 offspring characteristics are associated with increased risk for neglect and abuse by G2 parents; (4) to determine whether hypothesized protective factors in G2 parents provide a buffer against the transmission of neglect and abuse; and (5) to determine whether certain biomeasures (cortisol reactivity, Epstein-Barr Virus antibodies, and C-reactive protein) serve as potential biomarkers for the stress associated with childhood neglect or abuse in the G3 offspring. Using multiple methods and sources of information to determine neglect and abuse, we propose to conduct in-person interviews with all G2 adults (neglected, abused, and controls) who have children (N =753) and a subset of their children (G3) (N = 1406). Telephone interviews will also be conducted with G2 individuals who do not have children (N = 143). Using a new sampling technique for blood collection, we will assess cortisol reactivity, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) antibodies, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in G3 children. We will also collect official record information from child protection system agencies regarding maltreatment by G2 individuals or others directed at G3. This study's cohort design permits discovery of results with clear implications for the development of intervention and prevention programs. Findings regarding individuals who break the cycle of abuse have practical implications for the treatment and prevention of child maltreatment and theoretical importance for understanding the mechanisms and processes involved in the intergenerational transmission. Given the increasing interest in understanding the  mind-body  connection, this assessment of biomeasures in the G3 offspring may provide further insight into the impact of these childhood experiences.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly adults and those with high-risk cardiopulmonary conditions. Among community dwelling elderly and high-risk persons, RSV infections can be documented in 3-10 percent of persons annually and influenza A in 0-5 percent. Among hospitalized persons, RSV accounts for 9.7 percent of admissions for acute respiratory disease in the winter, compared to 12.1 percent for influenza A. The clinical impact of the two viruses is similar. Although the presence of underlying disease and low serum neutralizing antibody titers is correlated with risk of hospitalization, other factors are likely to contribute to disease severity. Results in experimental animal models have convincingly demonstrated that cellular immune responses to RSV are determining factors in lung pathology following infection. Neither the pathogenesis nor the cellular immune response to RSV in elderly persons has been investigated. This research will investigate those factors associated with severe RSV infection in older persons. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that age-associated changes in the RSV-specific cellular immune response during infection lead to impaired clearance of virus and more severe disease in the elderly. The research will be conducted in RSV infected young and old adults with a spectrum of disease severity ranging from mild to severe. Measures of the innate and adaptive cellular and humoral immune response, the kinetics of viral clearance, and inflammatory markers will be examined in these persons when they are seen in physician's offices or admitted to the hospital with symptomatic RSV illnesses. The interrelationships between these factors, older age, the presence of underlying diseases, and RSV disease severity will be determined by multivariate analysis. Using this data, the contribution of each factor to disease severity can be estimated. An understanding of disease pathogenesis useful for guiding optimal approaches to novel therapies and in development of vaccines for RSV in this age group. Assessment of viral load and possible spread to the lower airways, as well as the pattern of viral clearance in older adults will be important to better predict whether antivirals or immunomodulators will be useful. Additionally, this information coupled with knowledge of the immune and inflammatory response to infection will better allow us to predict the type of vaccine, adiuvants and delivery systems required to prevent infection and disease.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading viral cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections, accounting for an estimated 65 million infections and 1 million deaths annually worldwide. In the US, RSV causes approximately 100,000 hospitalizations per year in infant and elderly populations. RSV infection is also a significant cause of severe respiratory distress among the immunocompromised and those with underlying cardiopulmonary disease. Despite the significant health burden produced by RSV, there is currently no licensed RSV vaccine. This application proposes a new approach to development of an RSV vaccine candidate, and in fact a new approach to vaccine development in general, using nanotechnology. Increasingly, there is a realization that the commonality in sizes and general structural features between nanoparticles and their biological counterparts could translate into significant applications of nanoclusters to a wide variety of fields in biology and medicine. As a vaccine delivery vehicle, gold nanoclusters are very attractive candidates. A gold nanocluster of approximately 2.0-6.0 nm in diameter is stabilized by an estimated 140-150 monodentate ligands on its surface, creating the possibility for a high level of antigen presentation. Under appropriate conditions, surface-stabilizing ligands on gold nanoparticles may be exchanged, resulting in the potential for formulating a vaccine candidate incorporating both B cell and T helper cell epitopes into a single construct. Finally, colloidal gold is known to be phagocytosed by macrophages, and is safely used in human immunotherapy, establishing the plausibility of using these materials as vaccine platforms. Consequently, we hypothesize that the conformational protective B cell epitopes and T helper cell epitopes from RSV surface proteins recapitulated on the surface of a gold nanocluster will yield a vaccine candidate that induces protective efficacy through the induction of high titers of neutralizing antibodies. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following three specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Recapitulate conformational protective B cell epitopes and T helper cell epitopes from RSV surface proteins using synthetic peptides on the surface of a gold nanocluster (BTNCs). Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate that the magnitude and quality of the antibody response to the BTNC vaccine candidate is superior to that induced by peptide or multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) formulations. Specific Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that the resulting RSV F BTNC-based vaccine candidate induces superior protective efficacy in vivo, compared with available delivery systems for immunizing with viral peptides. The work proposed in this application will lead to the development of new vaccine candidates for respiratory syncytial virus, the most common cause of hospitalization of infants in the U.S. Successful development of an RSV vaccine could prevent over 100,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. every year, and prevent nearly 1 million childhood deaths a year. The development of a new technology for vaccination using nanoparticles also could have wide impact, since such a vaccine technology might be useful in developing vaccines against other infections.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This multidisciplinary project examines the transmission dynamics of multiple parasite species and their interactive effect on human populations in developing areas of coastal Kenya. In this ecological setting, transmission of Schistosoma haematobium, Plasmodium spp., filarial nematodes, and geohelminths is common, resulting in high levels of human urinary schistosomiasis, malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and hookworm infection. These infections, because of their combined long-term effects, appear to play a significant but, as yet, incompletely defined synergistic role in the causation of chronic clinical and subclinical human disease and poverty. In this context, transmission patterns and risk factors for these diverse parasitic infections often appear to be linked and to overlap extensively. However, to date, most studies have not approached the complexity of multi-parasite ecology because of limitations on data availability and accuracy and because of variable heterogeneities of infection risk that are found across physical and social space, and over time. The project's underlying hypothesis is that environmental factors are the key determinants of transmission potential for these parasites, and that these interact with demographic and socio-economic factors in determining the observed spatial/demographic patterns of parasitic disease. Recent research findings on parasite eco-epidemiology indicate that these effects all need to be reconsidered on multiple levels-individual, household, village, and district-wide-separately for each parasite, and for the combined suite of infections. Transmission processes and disease patterns vary across these multiple levels, and will also vary spatially and temporally within each level. The combined impact of these endemic infections has not been well studied, and may prove to have additive or more complex non-linear interactive effects. Consequently, optimal control strategies may prove to require local reduction of both transmission (preventing infection) and disease manifestations through the integrated targeting of one, some, or all of these parasitic infections in concert. Specific Aims of this project are to detect spatial and demographic patterns of transmission and infection for schistosomiasis, malaria, filariasis, and hookworms in coastal Kenya through integration of parasitological data with landscape, land use, and socioeconomic risk factors; to develop network- and individual-based models to identify the critical features of transmission and predict the potential impact of integrated control programs on distribution of malaria, filaria, schistosomes, and hookworm, and their related community disease impact; and strengthen training in infectious disease ecology for health problems in Africa.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): P/Q-type Ca currents conducted by Cav2.1 channels are responsible for the Ca entry that initiates neurotransmitter release at most fast glutamatergic synapses. Ca entering through presynaptic Ca channels forms a local domain of high Ca concentration that activates exocytosis in the near vicinity. Therefore, synaptic vesicles must dock near presynaptic Ca channels to be efficiently released. Neurotransmitter release is dependent on the third or fourth power of the Ca current through the presynaptic Ca channels, so small changes in Ca entry have large effects on synaptic transmission. Ca-dependent facilitation and depression of synaptic transmission is an important determinant of information coding and transmission in the nervous system. Our results in the present project period have given important new insights into the function and regulation of presynaptic Ca channels in synaptic transmission and short-term synaptic plasticity. First, we have further defined the molecular mechanism for interaction of Ca channels with SNARE proteins and the regulation of that interaction by protein phosphorylation. Second, we have shown that the calmodulin-like neuronal Ca sensor (nCaS) protein VILIP-2 regulates Cav2.1 channels by interaction at the same binding site as calmodulin and CaBP1, but has a distinct set of regulatory effects. Third, we have found that N-terminal myristoylation is required for the distinct regulatory effects of CaBP1 and VILIP-2 on Cav2.1 channels and that the N-terminal lobe of these nCaS proteins confers their specificity of regulation. Fourth, we have discovered that nCaS-dependent facilitation and inactivation of Cav2.1 channels is primarily responsible for short-term facilitation and depression of synaptic transmission in transfected superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neuron synapses, providing the first insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for short-term synaptic plasticity. Finally, we have found unexpectedly that Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) regulates Cav2.1 channels by specific binding to a site on the C-terminal domain, potentially positioning the kinase for rapid response to Ca entry and phosphorylation of nearby proteins. In the next project period, we plan to build on these important advances to: 1. further define the molecular mechanisms of binding and regulation of Cav2.1 channels by nCaS proteins; 2. determine the functions of nCaS proteins in short-term synaptic plasticity; 3. explore the signaling functions of CaMKII specifically bound to Cav2.1 channels; and 4. determine the functional role of presynaptic CaMKII in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. These experiments will provide novel insights into the regulation of presynaptic Ca channels and the role of this regulation in short-term synaptic plasticity, an essential form of information encoding and transmission in the nervous system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Calcium channels in nerve terminals begin the process of synaptic transmission, which communicates information from one nerve to cell to another as well as to muscle and hormone-secreting cells. Failure of correct function and regulation of these calcium channels contributes to epilepsy, migraine, ataxia, and other neurological diseases. Our proposed research will provide novel insights into the regulation of these presynaptic calcium channels and their function in short-term synaptic plasticity, an essential process for normal coding and transmission of information in the nervous system and a target for neurological disease.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children and is also a predictable cause of respiratory illness in persons of all ages. Despite advances in our understanding of RSV pathogenesis and immune response, efforts to develop an RSV vaccine have been unsuccessful. Based on RSV infections in humans and rodent challenge models, it is reasonable to predict that a successful RSV vaccine candidate will induce neutralizing antibody responses against the RSV fusion (F) protein and also induce Th1-dominant cellular responses. As a novel approach towards an RSV vaccine, we plan to exploit the unique biophysical and immunological properties of the human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 and L2 capsid proteins. L1 by itself or in concert with L2 self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) which elicit a broad array of immune responses. Based on the safety and efficacy data from large-scale clinical studies, HPV VLPs have recently been licensed as a subunit vaccine against cervical cancer. HPV VLPs may function as self-adjuvanting antigen delivery platforms that elicit humoral and Th1 cellular responses against heterologous antigens. Thus, we propose to generate HPV capsid proteins that bear portions of the RSV F protein and test the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of chimeric HPV/RSV VLPs in murine challenge models. This application utilizes the investigators' collective expertise in molecular biology, vaccine development, and virological and immunological aspects of HPV and RSV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children and is also a predictable cause of respiratory illness in persons of all ages. The proposed project may provide substantial progress towards the development of an RSV vaccine, which remains an unmet medical need.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to RFA-AI-07-034. We have constructed a model of systemic infection of immunocompetent mice by chimeric HIV-1, EcoHIV. Our previous studies indicate that EcoHIV replicates in lymphocytes and macrophages in infected mice, infection in mice is sensitive to antiretroviral drugs, productive infection persists for months inducing immune responses, and HIV-1 DNA vaccination can block infection in mice. Preliminary results reported here show that sexual transmission of EcoHIV in mice is rapid and efficient. Our overall goal in this application is to develop the mouse infection system to investigate the mechanisms of sexual transmission of HIV-1 as a platform to test efficacy of candidate microbicides. The Specific Aims of are: 1) to optimize conditions for sexual transmission of EcoHIV in mice and evaluation of interventions. 2) to identify the cell types involved in sexual transmission of EcoHIV. 3) to test the inhibition of sexual transmission of EcoHIV by antiretroviral-based microbicides. 4) to determine the HIV-1 subtype dependence of sexual transmission and efficacy of antiretroviral based microbicides against different HIV-1 subtypes. 5) to determine whether combination administration of an HIV-1 DNA vaccine followed by a microbicide can prevent sexual transmission of subtype B EcoHIV. Chimeric HIV-1 will be transmitted to conventional, immunocompetent female mice by mating with males infected through inoculation. Virus burden in multiple organs will be measured by real- time PCR and productively infected cells will be identified by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Accomplishment of Aims 1-3 will provide a firm foundation for and justification to extend the model to Aims 4-5 in studies directly relevant to the current HIV-1 epidemic and realistic means to control it. HIV-1 infection continues to spread worldwide, primarily by sexual transmission. The public health community responded to this pandemic by research into microbicides, compounds that women can apply to prevent transmission of HIV-1 during intercourse. Unfortunately, there is no simple way to determine which of many microbicides being developed actually blocks HIV-1 transmission before women begin their use. Some of the first to be tested by women in clinical trial actually increased HIV-1 transmission. This application is designed to develop a system for preclinical testing of microbicides in mice to determine their ability to reduce or prevent sexual transmission of HIV-1. We have shown that a form of HIV-1 that we genetically engineered to infect mice is very easily transmitted during mating. We propose to optimize this system to determine how well microbicides block sexual transmission of HIV-1. We shall also test in mice how the forms of HIV-1 that are widely distributed today can be controlled by microbicides. We have already shown that vaccination can reduce susceptibility to HIV-1 in mice. We also plan to both vaccinate mice and then treat with microbicides to determine if it is possible to completely prevent sexual transmission of the virus. Our hope is that the model of sexual transmission of HIV-1 in mice can accelerate the development of safe and effective microbicides that can be used to control the AIDS pandemic.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Vaginal HIV microbicides offer great promise to reduce HIV transmission, but phase 3 microbicide trials have failed. In some studies, patients using the microbicides had higher HIV transmission rates than did subjects using placebos. There is no clear explanation for these failures, but one hypothesis holds that microbicides alter the vaginal microbial flora in ways that increase inflammation or activate potential HIV host cells, enhancing transmission. Studies examining the effects of microbicides on the vaginal flora found few significant effects on the microbiome, but they used conventional culture techniques. Recent studies using molecular, culture-independent techniques showed that the flora in many human microbial environments, including the vagina, is much more complex than previously appreciated and that conventional culture techniques only detect a small fraction of the microbes in the environment. We propose to use these new culture-independent techniques to explore the hypothesis that microbicides alter the vaginal microbiome in ways that can potentially enhance HIV transmission via these specific aims: 1) Examine the vaginal microbial flora before and after microbicide application in a CONRAD repeat phase 1 study of nonoxynol-9 (N-9), cellulose sulfate (CS), and placebo using Affymetrix PhyloChip microarrays 2) Examine the portfolio of expressed genes in the vaginal microbiome before and after microbicide application using microbial cDNA sequencing in the phase 1 study, and 3) Examine the microbial species composition before and after microbicide application in the CONRAD CS phase 3 study that failed using the PhyloChip and direct 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The main milestone we propose to transition from the initial R21 phase of the project to the R33 phase is the demonstration that microbicide use leads to a significant alteration in the vaginal flora as assessed by the PhyloChip. Determining whether microbicide application is associated with vaginal microbiome changes that could enhance HIV transmission would aid understanding of the failure of the previous phase 3 trials and would help future microbicide development efforts because, if harmful changes in vaginal flora are associated with microbicide use, future microbicide development efforts would require careful measures to avoid inducing potentially harmful changes in the vaginal microbiome. Vaginal microbicides for the prevention of HIV sexual transmission offer great theoretical promise to reduce HIV sexual transmission and blunt the HIV pandemic, particularly in regions with the highest HIV prevalence rates. Unfortunately, several large late phase trials of HIV microbicides have failed for unknown reasons, with the research subjects using the microbicides having rates of HIV transmission higher than subjects using placebos. We hypothesize that one factor contributing to the failure of the microbicides is that their use produces a harmful change in the microbial flora living in the vagina, which leads to inflammation or activation of the cells that HIV replicates in, increasing the risks of HIV transmission. In our study, we propose to use new molecular biological techniques to comprehensively catalog essentially all of the microbes living in the vagina and determine how the use of HIV microbicides alters the population of the microbes. Determining that the use of HIV microbicides lead to a significant, potentially harmful alteration in the population of vaginal flora would help explain the failure of the existing microbicides to prevent HIV transmission and may help enable the development of new, more effect HIV microbicides.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together new data from Montreal and new theory from Michigan to generate a new understanding of how HIV spreads, of how spreading patterns alter the effects of control programs, and of how genetic analyses can be used to predict control results in any particular population. The Montreal data shows a high rate of clustering in HIV genetic sequences from early infection but little clustering from late infection. The clusters represent active transmission chains that might be detected and interrupted. The Michigan theory shows that risk behavior fluctuations interact strongly with high PHI transmission to affect transmission dynamics, the pattern of clustering, and the effects of HIV transmission control programs. The pattern of HIV clustering should therefore help predict transmission control program effects. We will define effective HIV control programs that balance efforts to detect and interrupt active transmission foci with efforts to decrease transmission through earlier treatment. That balance will differ when transmission is diffuse and constant or when it is punctuated by mini-epidemics of transmission during primary infection. The high rate of early diagnosis and virus sequence analysis in Montreal gives us the most refined view to date of the spatial-temporal dynamics of infection. The model analyses we now propose will greatly refine that view and clarify what effects different control strategies will have under different conditions. Our preliminary results show that behavioral risk fluctuations change expected intervention effects from both therapy and from interrupting active transmission chains. Fortunately, these effects are reflected by genetic sequence patterns. Accordingly we pursue 3 Aims. Aim 1 maps control program effects across a broad range of contact patterns, population structures, risk behaviors, and natural history of infection variants. Aim 2 maps transmission tree patterns on to that same space. This will allow interpretation of genetic patterns from anywhere where such patterns might be gathered. Aim 3 adapts models specifically to Montreal by fitting model parameter values in a two stage estimation process. The first stage fits deterministic compartmental models to HIV surveillance and special study data using an MCMC process. The second stage refines the parameter space estimated in the first stage by fitting genetic sequences on to transmission trees generated by a stochastic process model that has been shown on average to exactly reproduce the deterministic model results. In this refined parameter space the methods of Aim 2 indicate the consequences of various alternatives in HIV control program design.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Powerful new data are uniquely available from Montreal on how HIV transmissions during early infection are genetically, spatially, and temporally clustered. These will be analyzed using new theory developed at Michigan to determine how infection is flowing through a population and how early HIV Rx and traditional Public Health STD control actions can stop that flow. The new insights and analysis methods developed should help all control programs everywhere set more effective control priorities.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objectives of this proposal are to provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV-1 during heterosexual transmission. Previous studies examining subjects early after infection, but primarily after HIV-1 seroconversion, have yielded valuable insights. For instance, we and other have shown that newly infected subjects only acquire a subset of viruses from the array of viral variants circulating in the transmitting partner. In addition, viruses with compact and less glycosylated variants are favored for heterosexual transmission. The biological mechanism for the selection of these envelope genotypes during heterosexual transmission remains undefined. The viral envelope glycoprotein structure would predict that short and less glycosylated envelopes would have more open conformations leading to an enhanced affinity for host cell receptors and possibly greater antibody neutralization sensitivity. Because envelope modifications can occur soon after infection in the setting of the host humoral immune response, we propose to evaluate and compare envelope properties from newly infected recipients sampled prior to HIV-1 seroconversion and their transmitting partner. We will investigate receptor interactions and cell infection efficiencies of the envelopes from recipients and donors. In addition, we will test whether greater efficiency in infecting host cells through better viral envelope glycoprotein-host cell receptor interactions could confer fitness for transmission. Our studies aim to examine potential biological mechanisms that provide an advantage for viruses during heterosexual transmission. Our studies could have significant implications for microbicides efforts aimed at using receptor and fusion inhibitors to prevent viral entry. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of our proposal is to define the biological mechanisms that influence the selection of specific HIV-1 variants during transmission. We propose to examine a novel cohort of discordant couples to uniquely address receptor affinity and fusion kinetics differences among newly transmitted viruses and the majority of variants in the transmitting partner. We will explore the biological relevance of observed differences in these phenotypic properties to develop potential biological models for selection during HIV-1 transmission.',\n",
       " 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infections have been uniquely linked to the development and the severity of asthma. Virus-specific cellular immunity, particularly the CTL response, is implicated in the immunopathogenesis of RSV infection. We have shown that nasopharyngeal concentrations of MIP-1alpha, a prototype of viral-inducible airway epithelial chemokines, correlate with the degree of illness severity in RSV-infected children and that mice genetically deficient in MIP-1 alpha (-/-) have a striking reduction in lung inflammation. We hypothesize that MIP-alpha, by virtue of its activity on both NK cells and CTL, functions as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity to RSV, thus playing a crucial role in restricting viral replication, yet inducing mucosal inflammation, wheezing and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). In this project we propose the following aims: 1. Identify the contribution of MIP-1 alpha in the control of viral replication and development of RSV-induced lung inflammation, AHR and illness. Using MIP-1alpha -/- mice, we will test the hypothesis that MIP-let expression is necessary for viral clearance, but also linked to the pathogenesis of AHR and clinical illness in RSV infections. 2. Investigate the  requirement of MIP-1 et for the migration and activation of NK cells and NK-cell driven CTL responses in RSV infection. We will test whether MIP-1alpha promotes NK cell migration to the lung, activation, and antiviral function and whether it regulates NK-dependent RSV-specific CTL responses. 3. Analyze the spectrum of RSV-inducible proteins in thelung of mice, either control or MIP-1 alpha deficient, using a high-throughput proteomics approach with 2D SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. We will generate databases of lung proteins from RSV-infected mice to identify downstream proteins/mediators affected by MIP-let-dependent pathways. 4.  Analyze whether distinct protein patterns at the airway mucosal site can discriminate between infants with different severity of illness or degree of chemokine response following naturally-acquired RSV infection. By the high-throughputproteomics approach we will identify specific proteins or protein patterns in nasopharyngeal secretions that may contribute to the pathogenesis or severity of RSV-induced disease, and are associated with greater production of MIP-1alpha or other epithelial-derived chemokines. These studies will contribute to the identification of new strategies to promptly recognize, prevent, or early treat the most severe clinical forms of RSV infection in infancy, thus reducing the long-term burden of recurrent wheezing and asthma.',\n",
       " 'The long term objective of this research is to produce an effective vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus-type 1 (hPIV-1) and human parainfluenza virus-type 3 (hPIV-3). Sendai virus (mouse PIV-1) has proven effective as a vaccine for hPIV-1 in non-human primate studies, and developments in reverse genetic engineering now permit additional genes to be inserted as passengers in the Sendal virus genome. The recombinant Sendal viruses (rSV) that incorporate passenger genes for membrane proteins of other respiratory viral pathogens may thus provide protective immunity both to hPIV-1 and to the other viruses. To provide a foundation for the confident formulation of vaccines to be tested inprimates and humans, this section proposes an extensive course of experimentation to establish safety and efficacy in a laboratory rodent model, the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), in which human respiratory viruses grow well after intranasal inoculation.Initial Specific Aims in this project involve testing and comparing individual strains of rSV that carry genes for the attachment and fusion proteins of RSV or hPIV-3. Experiments are designed to assess the vigor of the humoral and cellular immune responses generated by rSV inoculations, and to evaluate associated protective immunity and immunopathological reactions. Our last Aim is to test increasingly complex combinations of rSV strains, with the final objective of formulating an optimized rSV cocktail that will function safely and effectively to provide protection from RSV, hPIV-1 and hPIV-3.Studies proposed in this Project (Project 2) will be highly interactive with Projects 1 and 3. Products and concepts from Project 1 will support each of the Specific Aims, which will, in turn, support the non-human primate and clinical studies in Project 3. Ultimately, we propose that the research from this interactive Program Project will yield a safe, effective and affordable respiratory virus vaccine for children.',\n",
       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza viruses (hPIV) types 1 and 3 are the most common causes of acute viral respiratory disease in infants and young children. Currently, no safe and effective RSV or PIV vaccine has been developed for the prevention of these pathogens. The objective of the multi-project program is to develop a multivalent vaccine using novel Sendal virus recombinants (rSV), generated by reverse genetic techniques, to deliver critical antigens of RSV and hPIV-3 to the pediatric population. In addition, the SV backbone will provide immunity against hPIV-1 based on relatedness of these two type 1 parainfluenza viruses.The Specific Aims of Project 1 descdbe our strategy to meet these objectives:Specific Aim 1: To construct and characterize a set of rSV expressing the envelope glycoproteins of hPIV-3 and RSV (types A and B), yielding a cocktail of first generation recombinants.Specific Aim 2: To compare the growth and target gene expression of rSV expressing membrane-bound versus secreted forms of the target glycoproteins of RSV and hPIV-3.Specific Aim 3: To prepare and characterize purified RSV and hPIV3 envelope glycoproteins, as a source of material for ELISA monitoring of antibody response and for possible boosting of rSV primed responses.This Project is highly related to the other two Projects in this application, rSV constructs, which differ according to the mode of the target antigen expression will be evaluated for immunogenicity by Project 2 investigators. Superior rSV will thus be selected and prepared in a formulation for the evaluation of safety and protection in a non-human primate model in Project 3. The combined Aims of Projects 1, 2 and 3 are intended to advance a SV-based respiratory virus vaccine to human trial for the prevention of serious respiratory virus infections in children.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unsuccessful attempts to develop a vaccine against HIV have led to a great need for new preventative strategies, the most encouraging of which are microbicides. An effective microbicide would decrease the severity of the AIDS epidemic by decreasing the rate of sexual transmission. A number of models systems have been developed to provide insights into the mechanisms of male-to-female sexual transmission including explant cultures and the rhesus macaque vaginal transmission model. These systems have been successfully used to evaluate and identify candidate microbicides. There has been much less progress in the development of systems to evaluate female-to-male sexual transmission. There are currently no model systems of female-to-male sexual transmission that can determine whether potential microbicides are capable of preventing infection via the penis. To fill this gap, this application seeks to develop an explant culture system using human penile tissue. This will enable the efficacy and safety of candidate microbicides that prevent the sexual transmission of HIV to males to be evaluated. Additionally, my laboratory has recently developed methodology that allows the detection of individual virions in tissue. This system will be further developed to determine how HIV normally interacts with human penile tissue. In the R21 component of this application we will optimize these systems to determine the normal interaction of HIV with intact tissue and subsequent viral replication. In the R33 phase of the application we will evaluate the potential of different candidate microbicides, individually and in combination, to alter HIV interaction with the tissue and prevent HIV infection and replication. We will also determine if exposure to the microbicide causes any changes in the tissue that may have deleterious effects on normal cell function.    The application seeks to develop new methods that determine whether chemicals can be used to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV. These methods will be used to determine the potency of protection from HIV infection, and the safety of the compounds before they are tested in humans. It is hoped that preventing HIV infection will decrease the number of people in the world infected with HIV and slow the AIDS epidemic.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) or Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Since the onset of the AIDS epidemic, KS has become the most frequently diagnosed }ediatdc tumor in sub-Saharan Africa. Vertical and horizontal transmission of HHV-8 has been reported, but the mechanisms of both routes remain poody understood. The first phase of our program to understand HHV-8 transmission focused on the possibility of vertical transmission in a high seroprevalence country, Zambia. By following a mother/infant cohort for more than three years, cases of perinatal transmission of HHV-8 in children were documented, but the rate is too low to account for the childhood seroprevalence observed. Moreover, we identified infants who seroconverted to HHV-8 when their mothers were not HHV-8 infected. Therefore, our findings suggest that a major mode of HHV-8 transmission in infants is horizontal. We have found that HHV-8 can be detected frequently in seroposiUve mothers' saliva, but not in breast milk between 2-6 months postpartum. The proposed study will focus on determining the incidence of and mechanisms by which horizontal HHV-8 transmission to children occurs in Lusaka, Zambia. A number of questions concerning the routes and factors that may affect this process will be addressed; one is the effect of HIV-1 infection in the donor or recipient, a second is the effect of high HHV-8 viral load, and another will be ethnographic behaviors or risk factors that may result in exposure of infants to HHV-8 contaminated saliva. Other questions of significant interest are: who is the most significant source of the virus (mother, father or other), and whether the presence of multiple HHV-8 infected individuals has direct impact on incidence or time to seroconversion. The overall objective is to establish the rates at which horizontal transmission of HHV-8 occurs and to identify virologic, immunologic and ethnographic risk factors that predispose children to infection by HHV-8. The proposed project will utilize relevant participants in the existing cohort and recruit additional subjects to substantiate analyses of the hypotheses within three defined and inter-related specific aims. It is anticipated that the proposed studies will define horizontal transmission rates in children, identify primary sources for horizontal virus transmission, and elucidate the potential risk factors involved. Moreover, it is anticipated that the information generated will be useful in the development of future intervention strategies.\",\n",
       " 'Respiratory synctial virus (RSV) is a major cause of often serious, life-threatening lung disease in infants andyoung children, immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients, patients suffering from cystic fibrosis,congenital heart disease, and the elderly. No effective vaccine is currently available for prevention of RSVdisease. Ribavirin, the only approved antiviral therapy, which must be administered by aerosol for 12 to 18hours/day for 3 to 7 days, is only marginally effective and has not been shown to significantly reduce mortalityassociated with RSV disease. While passive immunoprophylaxis with hyperimmune globulin or monoclonalantibody has been shown to reduce disease severity in some cases, satisfactory antiviral therapy has yet to beachieved. Leflunomide, an inhibitor of pyrimidine synthesis and protein kinase activity, is an anti-inflammatoryagent approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and is currently in clinical trials as an immunosuppressantin transplant recipients. This agent has been shown to exert powerful antiviral activity against cytomegalovirusin vitro and in vivo, and in preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies against RSV. The specific aims of thisinvestigation are to test the hypothesis that leflunomide reduces RSV viral load and associated bronchiolitis invivo, and to elucidate its antiviral mechanisms at the moleclular level. Cotton rats inoculated with RSV andtreated with leflunomide, ribavirin, Palivizumab, or combinations of theses agents will be euthanized atvarious intervals. Viral loads will be quantitated by plaque assay of lung homogenates, and tissue injury andpulmonary inflammation will be assessed by histologic and immunohistochemical analysis of lung tissue.Immune status of RSV-infected animals will be assessed by proliferation assays of splenocyte responses toRSV antigen. Molecular antiviral mechanisms will be elucidated by quantitative real time rtPCR assays of viralgenomic RNA synthesis and transcription, immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis of viral proteinsynthesis and phosphorylation, and immunogold electron microscopy. Data generated by these studies areanticipated to demonstrate the bifunctional utility of leflunomide in both the reduction in viral load and theconcurrent attenuation of the severe inflammatory reaction primarily responsible for RSV diseasemanifestations. Furthermore, elucidation of the molecular antiviral mechanisms of this agent may identify noveltargets for future antiviral drug development.',\n",

The results of these studies will enhance our understanding of the heterosexual transmission process and will yield novel information that is critical to the design and testing of globally effective vaccine candidates.  We analyzed HIV-1 virus populations isolated from both the donor and recipient immediately following a transmission event in unique cohorts of discordant couples in Rwanda and Zambia. These studies will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the virologic determinants of heterosexual transmission specified by the variable regions of gp120 in biologically relevant viral envelope genes using samples from large, well-characterized discordant couple cohorts that represent two predominant clades (A and C) of HIV-1. Our hypothesis is that extensions and heavy glycosylation of the first two variable regions of gp120 (V1V2) confer a selective advantage to the virus during long-term infection of an individual but that these same changes are disadvantageous during viral transmission, when variants with different modifications in V1V2 have a selective advantage.',\n",

Furthermore, the SIV/macaque model is important because knowledge of the time, route, and number of viral exposures Is known, the viral stock used to infect the macaques is well-characterized, and there is the ability to frequently sample important tissues (blood, lymph nodes, mucosal sites, etc) throughout infection. For HIV and SIV, the major mode of transmission for new infections is mucosal transmission, i.e. the virus has to pass through a mucosal membrane to infect the new host However, the probability to become infected from a mucosa] encounter is actually quite low. A variety of factors contribute to this low probability, including inhibitory proteins at mucosal surfaces, the difficulty to pass an intact mucosal membrane and the probability for the virus to find a suitable target cell to Infect Initially as soon as it passes the membrane. Using the macaque model, our laboratory has focused its work on oral transmission of HlV/SIV, a route that is important for mother-to-child (vertical) transmission through breast feeding and for transmission during oral sex when virus is present in semen. However, it still remains unclear what the most important events are which permit the actual transmission itself. Here we expand upon our previous findings by assessing the impact of immune activation on the transmission of SIV administered into the oral cavity of macaques. We hypothesize that higher levels of immune activation will increase the potential for SIV to elicit a productive infection. These studies will utilize a low dose regimen of viral Inoculations to mimic the viral levels that are present in breast milk and semen. We will assess transmission of SIV while the mucosa is experiencing a state of immune activation, gingivitis. Gingivitis is a common inflammation of the oral mucosa in humans and therefore may be impacting oral transmission in humans exposed to HIV containing semen (through receptive oral intercourse). These studies assessing the impact of the immune response on oral transmission are likely be applicable to other sites of mucosal transmission, and will be important for determining the immune mechanisms that impact the success of SIV/HIV mucosal transmission. Our long term goal is to utilize these findings to aid in the design of SIV/HlV vaccines that are able to elicit sterilizing immunity by preventing the infection of the first target cell when mucosal sites are exposed to HIV/SIV.',\n",

Although the initial events involved in vaginal transmission are uncertain, studies suggest that dendritic cells in the vaginal epithelium may be involved in trapping viral particles on the surface and transporting them to CD4+ T lymphocytes in the mucosa.  As a collaborative, multicenter trial with the Center for HIV and AIDS vaccine Initiative (CHAVI) we are continuing studies to determine the earliest target cells and events involved in vaginal HIV transmission using the macaque model of SIV/HIV transmission.  This year we have exposed 15 animals to various doses of a photoactivateable HIV that was generated by our collaborator Dr. Tom Hope.

The dramatic reduction in vertical transmission rates in the United States is related to several factors, including: increased provision and acceptance of voluntary counseling and HIV testing of pregnant women, improvements in the medical management of HIV- infected pregnant women, and the development and increased acceptance of interventions to decrease the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.  Specific U.S public Health Service guidelines recommend antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy appropriate to maximize health of the women.

Ribavirin is currently the only licensed therapeutic agent for RSV lower tract disease in hospitalized infants.  Although initial clinical trials of ribavirin suggested improved clinical outcome in hospitalized children with severe RSV disease, recent studies in children with or without underlying conditions failed to demonstrate efficacy.  It is evident that improved modes of therapy are needed to treat children with serious RSV infections.  One such possibility is the use of antibodies directed against neutralization epitopes of RSV.  There have been 3 previous small treatment studies with RSV-IGIV (Respigam¿; study RSV9201), palivizumab (Synagis¿; study MI-CP009), and motavizumab (MEDI-524; study MI-CP106).  In these trials, passive therapy with RSV-specific antibody was shown to be safe and well tolerated with no evidence of acute disease enhancement or long-term sequelae.  All 3 studies demonstrated a reduction in RSV viral load in the lower respiratory tract.  The study with motavizumab showed a significant reduction in the cultivatable virus in the upper airway compared to placebo, and there was a trend toward a dose-effect with greater reduction in viral load as measured by real-time RT-PCR in the 30 mg/kg motavizumab-treated children.  However, some of the children treated with the 30 mg/kg dose of motavizumab did not have consistently detectable motavizumab levels in the nose.  With the encouraging findings of reduction in viral load and a suggestion of clinical benefit in the previous small studies, the current study is being conducted to determine if there can be a further reduction in viral load and if higher levels of motavizumab can be attained in the upper respiratory tract in children hospitalized with RSV when treated with a higher dose of motavizumab.  If the findings from this initial study are positive, then additional studies of the effect of motavizumab on clinical outcomes in hospitalized children treated for RSV would be warranted.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long term goal is to establish animal models for human influenza infection, pathogenesis, transmission and evolution. There is particular concern about the possibility that avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype could lead to a pandemic. These viruses are transmitting directly from birds to humans, although they have been unable yet to maintain sustained human-to-human transmission. We propose to study the mechanisms that avian influenza viruses require to infect mammals as well as the potential evolution of those viruses to transmit human-to-human which is required to cause a pandemic. The molecular basis for the efficient transmission of influenza viruses from among humans is not well understood, although the aerosol transmission is known to be important in the process. With the emergence of direct transmission of influenza viruses from avian species to humans but little human-to-human transmission, it is crucial to determine the genetic traits that lead to efficient transmission of potentially pandemic viruses in humans. We propose two specific aims to address: 1) The transmissibility potential of human H1, H2, and H3 viruses as well as avian H5, H7, and H9 viruses that have been implicated in bird-to-human infections. We will determine the effect of particle size for efficient aerosol spread and the effect that virus morphology has to establish a natural chain of transmission in the ferret model. We will compare the effect of influenza infections in two animal model systems, the ferret and the cotton rat, both of which can display typical flu symptoms without requiring virus adaptation. We will use unrestrained whole body plethysmography to determine the frequency of respiration, airway responsiveness (ratio of inspiration to expiration) and time between breaths and compare them with the effect of aerosolization of influenza virus particles. We will study virus survival in sputum samples of infected ferrets to better understand the natural conditions that might affect the stability of the virus and its effect for efficient transmission. 2) We will generate avian/human reassortant influenza viruses by reverse genetics or by co-infection of ferrets with an avian and a human strain to determine whether such reassortants are viable and better define the factors that control transmission of avian influenza viruses in this animal model system.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PB1-F2 protein is the most recently discovered influenza A virus protein. The protein is translated from the +1 reading frame of the PB1 gene of the influenza A virus genome. This small protein of 87 amino acids has been shown to cause apoptosis in infected cells. PB1-F2 interacts with the mitochondrial membrane proteins adenine nucleotide translocator 3 (ANT3) and voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC1) and this interaction induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway as shown by Zamarin et al. It has also been shown in the mouse model that viruses knocked out for PB1-F2 expression have reduced pathogenicity. Previous studies show that PB1-F2 contributes to pathogenesis and that amino acid change N66S in the C-terminus can increase pathogenicity in the mouse model. In this study we will examine the effects of PB1-F2 on transmission in the guinea pig model. We hypothesize that increased virus replication and pathogenesis caused by PB1-F2 in animal models may lead to more efficient transmission. Our study will focus on the use of the recombinant A/Texas/91 virus. This virus model has been used in previous transmission experiments in ferrets to examine the contribution of H5N1 and 1918 pandemic virus genes to pathogenesis. A/Texas/91 is a good model to study transmission because preliminary experiments have shown that this virus has a 17% transmission rate without expressing a full-length PB1-F2. PB1-F2 can be expressed without changing any other proteins or genes of the virus, by fixing a stop codon to a tryptophan in the coding sequence of PB1-F2. This is ideal because we know that there is not an inherent block in transmission coming from other genes of the virus, but we will also be able to observe changes, either increases or decreases in transmission. The experiments outlined in this proposal are designed to examine the effects of PB1-F2 on transmission in the guinea pig model using the recombinant A/Texas/91 virus.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a severe (case fatality = 35%) rodent-borne viral disease of the Americas. Sin Nombre hantavirus (SNV) hosted by the widespread deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) is responsible for the majority of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases in the United States. The design and implementation of effective disease prevention interventions for HPS and the targeting of these interventions depends upon a detailed knowledge of the factors controlling SNV propagation in host populations. Field studies have identified the primary routes of transmission between mice and humans and among deer mice. However, because of difficulties in achieving natural virus transmission in the laboratory environment, laboratory studies have contributed little to clarifying the dynamics of SNV infection and transmission in deer mouse populations. The main objective of this project is to study the SNV infection cycle and transmission dynamics within enclosed, outdoor deer mouse populations. These controlled field experiments will elucidate the temporal pattern of virus transmission in mice, patterns of viral shedding, and social, demographic, and ecological factors that contribute to the transmission and maintenance of SNV in deer mouse populations. This information is critical to understanding changes in human risk and developing models to predict times and places of increased human disease risk.',\n",

       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the primary cause of respiratory infection in young children, causing >120,000 hospitalizations in the US annually. RSV vaccine development has been hampered by the history of a failed vaccine trial in the early 1960s in which vaccinated children were not protected against subsequent natural infection but rather experienced more severe disease. Subsequent experiments in animal models and human subjects suggest the occurrence of severe RSV disease correlates with the induction of virus-specific Th2 CD4+ T cells and eosinophil recruitment and degranulation. The putative attachment G glycoprotein of RSV and killed virus vaccines containing adjuvants such as alum are particularly effective in inducing such disease-enhancing immune responses. The purposes of these studies are 1) to define the precise components of RSV immunity that predispose for severe RSV disease upon subsequent exposure to the virus, 2) to determine how the structure of RSV contributes to disease, and 3) with this better understanding of RSV pathogenesis, to rationally design RSV vaccines that protect against infection without enhancing disease.',\n",
       " \"HIV transmission within the body is primarily thought to occur via the direct       interaction of virus positive-cells with uninfected target cells. Virus-positive cells are       comprised of either cells that were previously infected or cells that have captured and       maintained HIV in an infectious form on their cell surface. Impairing the cell-to-cell       transmission of HIV is essential to stopping spread within the body and from person-to-person.       We have constructed immunologically relevant model systems in cell culture to examine the       cell-virus and cell-cell interactions that are required for virus transmission. Blood       dendritic cells (DCs) efficiently capture and transmit HIV to CD4+ T lymphocytes, the main       reservoir of virus infection in the body. DCs serve as immune system sentinels and patrol       mucosal surfaces for invading pathogens to provide early warning to the adaptive immune       system. Mucosal tissue exposure to HIV is the most frequent cause of HIV transmission       worldwide. Because DCs are concentrated at these tissues, it is hypothesized that they are       co-opted by HIV during mucosal transmission to gain access to the lymphatic system and seed       infection of the CD4+ T cell compartment. DC-SIGN is a high-affinity HIV Env receptor       expressed by activated B cells, a subset of blood macrophages, mucosal DCs, and in vitro       differentiated monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). MDDCs and activated B cells treated with       antibodies to DC-SIGN bind less HIV and are less effective in stimulating infection of CD4+ T       cells. In addition, ectopic expression of DC-SIGN in transformed B cells enables efficient HIV       capture and transmission to susceptible target cells. Cell biological analysis has revealed       the concentration of HIV at synaptic junctions after DC contact with CD4+ target cells. It has       been postulated that examination of DC-SIGN-mediated HIV transmission by transformed       cell lines could aid in the characterization of these processes. Transformed cells would allow       more extensive biochemical characterization and genetic manipulation of the cellular sorting       machinery, cell signaling processes, and cell-cell adhesion molecules required for synaptic       transfer of HIV. Our group was the first to show the feasibility of modeling DC-SIGN-mediated       transmission using transformed B cells in contrast to other cell types. We have used these       differences to investigate cellular requirements for the DC-SIGN-mediated HIV transmission.       These studies reveal that HIV traffics differently in cells that are permissive and       restrictive to transmission and suggests that other cell factors regulate this process. In the       course of these studies, we have found that GFP-labeled virus-like particles (VLPs) can be       used to monitor the requirements of DC-SIGN- or DC-mediated transmission of HIV. We are now       using VLPs to investigate residues of DC-SIGN required for interaction with HIV Env and to       determine whether cell specific modification of DC-SIGN also regulates these interactions.       These studies will increase our understanding of the cell-to-cell transmission of HIV, and       they could provide the basis for rational design of antiviral drugs that prevent HIV use of       DC-SIGN in virus transmission.

       " 'Respiratory viral infections are associated with both the induction and exacerbation of allergic conditions including allergic asthma. These processes require activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. The focus of our Lab is on the contribution of RSV- and dsRNA-responsive molecules in anti viral innate and adaptive immunity.\\tThese molecules include the dsRNA-activated protein Kinase (PKR), scavenger receptor type-A (SR-A), and transforming growth factor-&#946; (TGF-&#946;). Our recent data showed that during viral infections and subsequent cell lysis, the released dsRNA was taken up into the cells through interaction with SR-A. After internalization, PKR, which is a dsRNA-specific signaling molecule, is activated and induces inflammatory and regulatory cytokines and chemokines. \\tWe previously reported that RSV replication was enhanced in the presence of TGF-&#946;.

       " 'Jesse L. Brunner, Proposal EF- 0914418, Fear, Food, and Infections: Linking Host Behavior to Disease Transmission in the Ranavirus-Salamander System.Detailed knowledge of how infectious agents are transmitted is key to predicting whether an infectious disease will invade, persist, and spread, and to designing control strategies.. Yet we know very little about how transmission works in real world systems. Much of our present understanding stems from models that assume hosts contact each other randomly, like molecules colliding in a chemical reaction. Animals are not molecules; they mate, forage, fight, and flock, and these behaviors can drive the spread of disease. This project will use a salamander-virus model system coupled with simple mathematical models to evaluate how common host behaviors, such as foraging for food and avoiding predators, shape transmission dynamics. Experiments are proposed to evaluate how certain host behaviors (e.g., by introducing a predator) influence the spread of a virus through the population. For instance, one would predict that when animals aggregate together in the face of a predator, disease transmission will increase. Alternatively, when hosts reduce their movements (e.g., when hiding) transmission may slow.This study will provide the foundation for a predictive, behavior-based theory of disease transmission. This study may also lead to novel ways of intervening in disease outbreaks (e.g., by carefully arranging food resources or refuges from predators). The investigator will offer short workshops on wildlife disease epidemiology and modeling to students and wildlife professionals, and train undergraduate and graduate researchers in behavioral ecology, disease ecology, epidemiology and statistics, as well as in laboratory and field methods.',\n",

The major theme of my research is utilizing mouse models and viral genetics to study viral pathogenesis in vivo. In my postdoctoral fellowship, I am investigating respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pathogenesis in the laboratory of Stokes Peebles, MD at Vanderbilt. My education, training, and productivity are enhanced by a mentor with strong basic science and clinical backgrounds as well as the departmental and institutional environments. My immediate goals are to progress with the Aims of this proposal and obtain an assistant professor position at a biomedical research institution. We reported that infection of mice with the RSV line 19 strain, but not the A2 strain resulted in mucus production, lung IL 13 expression, and airway dysfunction. Thus, the line 19 strain of RSV is a model for investigating RSV-induced mucus/airway dysfunction. We sequenced the line 19 genome and identified RSV mucus-inducing gene candidates. Aim 1 will utilize RSV reverse genetics to map the region of the line 19 genome sufficient for infection-induced mucus/airway dysfunction. We found that distinct clinical isolate RSV strains induce differential pathogenesis in mice. RSV A/2001/2 20 strain induces higher lung IL 13 and airway mucus expression, as well as greater disease severity and histopathology in mice than the A2, line 19, and A/2001/3 12 strains. Aim 2 will utilize RSV reverse genetics to map the gene(s) of A/2001/2-20 sufficient for elevated pathogenicity compared to the A/2001/3 12, a co-circulating RSV strain. Aim 2 will also define the roles of IL 13 and STAT6 in A/2001/2-20 pathogenesis. Defining mechanisms and the molecular basis of RSV strain-specific pathogenesis will improve our understanding of the sequelae of RSV. My long-term objectives are to be a productive, independent investigator in the field of viral pathogenesis and provide insights into RSV pathogenesis that translate into therapies and/or vaccines for RSV disease. My research will emphasize viral immunology and mechanisms of pulmonary pathogenesis. My long-term research goals are to elucidate mechanisms by which RSV causes mucus production/airway dysfunction and define how RSV genotype diversity affects RSV immunopathogenesis. The Future Directions section describes how the Specific Aims here will lead to hypotheses towards my long-term goals. Relevance: RSV causes >100,000 infant hospitalizations in the US each year and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia in infants. Mucus production is a hallmark feature of RSV disease, leading to airway obstruction, hypoxia, and mechanical ventilation. Mechanisms of RSV-induced mucus are unknown and the focus of this proposal.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Alterations in dopamine transmission occur during drug abuse and addiction. To understand these changes, it is necessary to first understand the basic physiology that underlies dopamine transmission. The aim of this Pathway to Independence Award (K99/ROO) proposal is to investigate the mechanisms of dopamine transmission while providing the candidate (Dr Christopher Ford) with the necessary mentored training in electrophysiological and electrochemical techniques. The applicant's long-term career goal is to develop into an independent investigator studying the molecular and cellular basis of addiction. To meet this goal, this proposal is designed to (1) provide the candidate with the technical and theoretical training required to determine how dopamine mediates transmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and (2) provide the candidate with the career-development training required to establish his own independent research career as an R01-funded assistant professor. The career development plan involves mentorship by a highly established drug abuse researcher (Dr John T Williams) in electrophysiological and electrochemical techniques. Combining these two tools to examine dopamine transmission has not been performed to date and as such has the potential to provide a unique opportunity for the candidate to initiate an independent career. The central aim of this proposal is to determine the relationship between extracellular dopamine and its physiological consequences. The objective during the mentored phase will be to determine the mechanisms regulating dopamine transmission. The hypothesis to be tested is that dopamine mediates transmission in the VTA in a tightly regulated, synaptic manner. The objective during the independent phase will be to define the concentration and duration of dopamine mediating transmission. The hypothesis being that transient, high concentrations of dopamine mediate transmission. A lack of knowledge of the basic mechanisms of dopamine transmission has hindered progress towards determining how transmission becomes dysregulated during the course of drug addiction. Thus this work has the potential to identity and direct new strategies to treat drug abuse and addiction.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Determining the mechanisms by which dopamine mediates transmission is a key first step to providing the framework necessary for understanding how this system is altered as a result of chronic drug use. A better understanding of the events linking dopamine release to its physiological actions will be significant as it has the potential to direct new strategies for the treatment of drug abuse and addiction.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important etiologic agent of pediatric viral respiratory infection and remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality among infants as well as immunocompromised subjects and the elderly. Long-term effects of severe RSV infection during infancy include wheezing and asthma later in life. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine for RSV, nor are there effective curative treatments for severe RSV disease. Prophylactic injection of anti-RSV immunoglobulin (palivizumab) is used for high-risk individuals clinically, although the cost- effectiveness of this treatment is unclear. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop robust antiviral therapies for RSV. We have recently shown that inhibition of the Akt signal transduction pathway reduced RSV replication, in addition to the replication of a number of other non-segmented negative- sense RNA viruses, in cultured cells. We propose to determine the potential for targeting Akt to treat severe RSV infection by focusing on following specific aims: 1) determine how signaling through the Akt pathway affects RSV replication; and 2) define the mechanism by which Akt inhibition blocks RSV replication. These studies will allow us to identify and characterize a host protein thats is a novel drug target for the inhibition of RSV replication. Akt inhibitors have been used in the pre-clinical trials as anti-cancer treatments and have been shown to be safe and effective. Thus, we hypothesize that similar Akt inhibitors can be used both prophylactically and therapeutically to prevent the development of severe RSV disease in a safe and efficacious manner. In addition, understanding how Akt inhibitors block RSV replication may allow us to define a specific pathway necessary for paramyxovirus replication in general, allowing the development of broad spectrum antiviral therapeutics that are effective against an array of human viral diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Respiratory syncytial virus is the leading cause of pediatric viral illness. Currently, the only effective antiviral treatment to prevent RSV infection is prophylactic injection of monoclonal antibody to RSV F protein; however, the cost-effectiveness of this treatment is under debate. We are proposing to identify and characterize a novel drug target of RSV that can potentially be used both prophylactically and therapeutically in a clinical setting.',\n",
       " 'Infections with RSV are one of the major causes of viral lower respiratory tract illness. Protection against RSV may be achieved with an efficient vaccination strategy that induces neutralizing humoral immunity and a Th1-dominant cellular response and that does not predispose to Th2-dominant vaccine-induced exaggerated RSV disease. Based on the knowledge that adenovirus (Ad) gene transfer vectors can be used to evoke robust systemic and mucosal immunity against an immunogen expressed as a transgene and that Ad functions as a potent adjuvant, this proposal focuses on the development of a vaccine against RSV using modified Ad vectors. The Ad modifications include the addition of an RGD motif to the fiber knob, a modification known to enhance infection of antigen presenting cells and enhance Th1 immunity, as well as the incorporation of RSV epitopes into the Ad capsid. To assess if anti-RSV immunity can be elicited even in the presence of anti-human Ad immunity, the vectors will be based on the non-human primate serotype AdC7, against which humans do not have immunity. These modified vectors will be assessed for the ability to induce immunity and protection against RSV in mice, with particular focus on potential vaccine-enhanced RSV lung disease. Two specific aims outline the studies to achieve these goals. Aim 1. To evaluate the hypothesis that an optimized AdC7 vector, which is engineered to increase activation and infection of antigen presenting cells, and which expresses the RSV F protein, as a transgene, will evoke robust protective immunity against RSV without causing vaccine-induced RSV disease and in the context of pre-existing human Ad immunity. Aim 2. To evaluate the hypothesis that modified AdC7 vectors engineered to contain epitopes of the RSV F and G proteins in the capsid hexon protein, a strategy that enables boosting of the immune response with the identical vector, will evoke robust immunity against RSV without predisposing to vaccine-induced RSV lung disease.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria transmission entails development of the Plasmodium parasite in the mosquito. We have identified a critical interaction between an unknown ookinete lectin-like protein and a chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan ligand on the mosquito midgut lumenal surface. We hypothesize that by disrupting this interaction through the use of small molecule inhibitors we can prevent parasite establishment in the mosquito and, subsequently, completely abrogate malaria transmission. This is a translational research grant proposal with the goal of taking our basic research understanding of Plasmodium-mosquito host interactions toward the development of novel highly potent malaria transmission-blocking therapeutics. Our first aim, the Complete molecular characterization of Plasmodium ookinete protein-midgut glycosaminoglycan interactions involves (1) identifying novel lectin-like ookinete molecules by glycan-affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, (2) characterizing their functional role in vivo through the production of gene knockout parasites, (3) assessing their binding affinity for mosquito chondroitin glycosaminoglycans by protein array-surface plasmon resonance, and (3) gaining insight into the structure-function of the molecule(s) in complex with chondroitin glycosaminoglycan fragments and structural analogues by molecular modeling and x-ray crystallography. The second aim of the project, the Development of lead Plasmodium transmission-blocking glycan-mimetic compounds and assessment of their transmission-blocking potential involves identification of novel derivatives and analogues of our lead transmission-blocking compound, VS1 (a non-peptidyl polyvinylsulfonated polymer), which is a structural mimic of midgut chondroitin glycosaminoglycans and inhibits >95% of parasite development in the mosquito. To develop more potent structural analogs, we propose a four-tiered approach: (1) isolation of varying chain-lengths of the VS1 polymer, (2) derivitization of VS1 to enhance inhibitory activity and bioavailability, (3) derivitization of (+)-usnic acid, a polyphenolic compound from lichens, and (4) assessment of the utility of peptide mimotopes of mosquito chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans as transmission-blocking vaccine targets. To help progress toward preclinical studies, the top candidate compounds from each approach will be analyzed for their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in animal and human serum models.     Mosquitoes transmit the Plasmodium parasite from infected human hosts to uninfected individuals. By blocking a critical protein-glycan (carbohydrate) interaction between the parasite and the mosquito vector through the use of small inhibitory compounds (drugs) we prevent parasite establishment in the mosquito and effectively disrupt the transmission cycle of the malaria parasite. This strategy is especially important given that many current antimalarials and vaccine candidates still permit transmission of the parasite through the mosquito, moreover, our lead compound has added potential utility as a multi-stage antimalarial therapeutic since it also prevents sporozoite establishment in liver cells, the first step towards the progression of disease in humans.',\n",

Poor patient compliance with screening procedures increases the mortality due to colorectal cancer. There is an urgent need for chemopreventive measures for this tumor type. One of the most promising chemopreventives in recent years is the dietary polyphenol resveratrol (RSV). While RSV has shown effective anticancer properties in cellular and rodent models, one limit to its development as a drug is its extremely high metabolism and resultant low oral bioavailability. There is ample evidence for therapeutic efficacy of RSV despite its high metabolism. The pharmacologic effects of RSV metabolites have never been elucidated. The overall goal of this proposal is to characterize the pharmacology of the major conjugated metabolites of RSV, and to delineate the effect of RSV on conjugating enzyme expression and activity. This research will advance our knowledge of a potential new chemopreventive drug, RSV, its pharmacology, and its potential for drug-drug interactions. We hypothesize that RSV conjugation plays an important role in its therapeutic effects via either inactivation or production of active metabolites. RSV is additionally hypothesized to alter its own conjugation by inhibition or induction of xenobiotic conjugating enzymes. Two specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine the pharmacologic activity of RSV conjugates, and 2) Characterize the effect of RSV on human uridine glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and sulfotransferase (SULT) induction / inhibition. We will synthesize the major metabolites of RSV and test their role in cell proliferation with colon cancer cell lines (FHC controls, Caco-2, HT-29, and HCT-116) as our model. We will additionally evaluate changes in UGT / SULT protein expression and enzyme activity in human hepatocytes as well as colon cells upon treatment with RSV or its metabolites. Protein expression will be quantitated with western blot analysis, while enzyme activity will be characterized with specific substrates toward each isozyme. Taken together, these experiments will provide the first evaluation of the pharmacology of RSV metabolites, and the effect of RSV in regulation of enzymes responsible for its metabolism.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Education and microbicides active against HIV represent the best approaches to controlling the epidemic worldwide in the absence of a protective vaccine. Our research program studies the earliest events in genital tract transmission. We have identified a protein expressed by genital tract epithelial cells that could serve as a potential target for inhibition of transmission of HIV called gp-340. We have demonstrated that gp-340 is expressed on the cell surface of vaginal and cervical epithelial cells, in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo and binds HIV envelope. Of significance to genital tract transmission, gp-340 binding of virus leads to an increase in both the infectivity and half-life of the virus. Gp-340 expressed by genital tract tissue and cell lines also mediates transcytosis of HIV, the vesicular transport of macromolecules from one side of a cell to the other. A second molecule called syndecan has been studied and shown to have similar trans-infection and transcytosis properties and is also expressed by genital tract cells. We have identified a peptide inhibitor of envelope binding to gp-340 that blocks both gp-340 mediated trans-infection and transcytosis in in vitro and ex vivo models of genital tract transmission. This peptide contains a portion of a motif that inhibits syndecan mediated transinfection, as well, and we will modify this peptide to inhibit envelope binding to both macaque gp340 and syndecan and develop it into a microbicide. This potential role of gp-340 and syndecan to act at a stage of infection after delivery to the lumen of the genital tract but prior to interaction with and infection of target cells is very attractive and novel in microbicide design. We hypothesize that interfering with this process will inhibit or block genital tract transmission. In the initial R21 portion of this proposal, we will establish in vitro macaque systems of genital tract transmission. If we demonstrate that macaque gp340 and syndecan mediate trans- infection and transcytosis and V3 loop derived peptides or improved versions block macaque gp340 and syndecan mediated transinfection and transcytosis, we will proceed with the R33 portion of the grant. The specific aims of this are: microbicide development with in vitro testing and to test the effect of blocking gp340 and syndecan-HIV Env interaction on genital tract SIV transmission in the rhesus macaque vaginal transmission model. Through these specific aims, we will develop a new type of microbicide and determine the role of genital tract gp-340 and syndecan in HIV transmission. If successful, these studies will deliver a new microbicide based on host cell interactions with HIV that promote genital tract transmission to preclinical trial studies.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Women bear the greatest burden of new HIV infections throughout the world. Nevertheless, our understanding of the biology underlying HIV transmission and pathogenesis in women is incomplete. The overarching goal of this PO1 proposal is to unite a dynamic research team with complementary expertise that bridges HIV molecular biology, reproductive biology, immunology, and clinical and epidemiological research to address important, unanswered questions. 1) What sites in the female reproductive tract are most involved in HIV transmission? 2) What HIV properties and host factors critically affect transmission rates? 3) How do endogenous or exogenous sex hormones impact transmission frequency and do these factors modulate innate and adaptive immune responses in the female reproductive tract that counter infection? 4) Why have all tested vaginal microbicides not only failed to stop but often caused paradoxical increases in HIV infection? 5) Can the safety of new microbicide candidates be better assessed before large scale clinical testing? We hypothesize that 1) the upper female reproductive tract represents a highly permissive but understudied portal for HIV infection, 2) specific viral (Env) and host (semen peptides) factors importantly influence the success of male-to-female HIV transmission, 3) changes in sex hormone levels (progestin-only contraception) enhance HIV transmission and menopause adversely modulates both mucosal and systemic innate and adaptive immune responses to HIV, and 4) ineffective and unsafe microbicides activate common patterns of gene expression in the upper female reproductive tract, creating a cellular milieu that favors HIV transmission. Identification of these genes will permit construction of a predictive genetic signature for  microbicide harm.  These hypotheses will be tested in three specific aims involving extensive cross-project collaborations. Specific Aim 1: To study viral and host factors regulating male-to-female transmission of HIV in the female upper genital tract (Warner Greene, MD, PhD); Specific Aim 2: To explore the upper female reproductive tract as a portal of HIV transmission and to assess effects of sex steroids and microbicides on these tissues (Linda Giudice, MD, PhD, and Karen Smith-McCune, MD, PhD, and Specific Aim 3: To investigate immunopathogenesis of HIV in the female reproductive tract (Barbara Shacklett, PhD). These studies will be enabled by two essential cores, the Clinical and Data Core (Ruth Greenblatt, MD) and the Administrative Core (Drs. Greene and Greenblatt).   RELEVANCE: Together, these studies promise to greatly extend our understanding of the molecular, cellular, and immunological basis for HIV transmission and pathogenesis in women. This work could also propel future efforts aimed at developing effective biomedical approaches to interdict male-to-female transmission of HIV.       PROJECT 1:  Viral and Host Factors Promoting Male-to-Female Transmission of HIV  (Project Leader:  GREENE, W)    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Male-to-female (M->F) transmission of HIV is a major force driving expansion of the global AIDS epidemic.  Our overall objective is to assess the potentially important role played by select viral and host factors in HIV transmission biology. In Specific Aim 1, HIV transmission pairs will be used to test the hypothesis that the envelope proteins from viruses successfully transmitted to women differ from non-transmitted viruses by their fusogenic properties and/or target cell selectivity. Envelopes from transmitted viruses share common features including compact V1-V4 regions, decreased numbers of glycosylation sites, and a greater sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. These viral envelopes may be imbued with special properties that favor virion fusion to target cells within the female reproductive mucosa. In Specific Aim 2, biological features of recently identified fibrillar peptides in semen that can enhance HIV infection 10-100,000-fold will be tested. These peptides, termed semen enhancer of HIV infection (SEVI), are produced by endoproteolytic cleavage of prostatic acid phosphatase, a highly abundant semen protein. They enhance HIV infection by sharply increasing virion attachment to target cells. Our studies will test the hypothesis that SEVI propels M->F transmission of HIV and further that SEVI antagonists may impair HIV infection of women. Our studies specifically seek to: 1) identify the cellular protease(s) responsible for the generation of SEVI, 2) test whether SEVI enhances virion transcytosis, trans-infection, and cell-cell infection, 3) explore whether SEVI production varies among males and whether HIV infection alters SEVI levels, and 4) investigate novel approaches for inhibiting the action of SEVI. Effective SEVI antagonists could find application in future multicomponent microbicides designed to prevent HIV transmission to women. This project will also interact extensively with Projects 2 and 3 of this P01 application. Viruses containing primary transmitted envelopes will be provided for use in these projects. Fusion assays will be performed collaboratively to monitor effects of progestin contraceptives, menopause, and microbicides on HIV target cells within female reproductive mucosa. Semen, SEVI, and SEVI antagonists will also be profiled for potential  harm  effects on endometrial and cervical mucosa. Together, the multiple lines of investigation described in Project 1 promise to expand our understanding of the molecular basis for M->F transmission of HIV.  RELEVANCE:  An improved understanding of the molecular underpinnings of M??F transmission of HIV could result in new approaches for curbing HIV infection in women including rational approaches for development of female controlled microbicides and prophylactic vaccines active at mucosal surfaces.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mosquito-borne viral diseases remain significant causes of morbidity and mortality throughout much of the world and impose tremendous burdens on human and animal care infrastructures. It is critical that we have a better understanding of the molecular basis of vector competence and arbovirus transmission by mosquitoes. Genome sequence information and other bioinformatics are available for three major vector species (Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens). New techniques are still needed by vector biologists and arbovirologists to fully exploit this explosion of information and develop a more complete understanding of mosquito-borne disease transmission. For the last 15 years, AIDL researchers have been at the forefront developing molecular tools termed alphavirus transducing systems or ATS's that allow gene expression in a variety of mosquito (and insect) species. ATS's have facilitated gene expression in adult mosquitoes, allowed functional analyses of vector and alphavirus genes, and have been used in the study of mosquito-alphavirus interactions. Vector biologists at AIDL, and elsewhere, are currently manipulating innate immune pathways in mosquitoes and need tools such as ATS's to characterize the effects of these manipulations on arbovirus transmission. Virologists here and at other institutions are testing new antiviral vaccines and drugs in animal models and need tools that facilitate virus exposure of animals by the natural route of infection. We think that ATS's technology coupled with fluorescent and bioluminescent technology can be an important addition in our arsenal of tools that allow us to observe (in real time) arbovirus transmission. This approach will have an added benefit of reducing the numbers of animals that are needed for transmission and pathogenesis analyses and in evaluating antiviral protection in animals. The specific aims of this grant renewal are as follows: 1) use ATS's to develop mosquito transmission models for alphaviruses, 2) use these transmission models to understand and improve ATS's induction of RNA interference (RNAi) in mosquitoes and its impact on transmission, and 3) generate novel mosquito reporters of alphavirus infection and transmission. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mosquito-borne viral diseases are significant causes of illness and death throughout much of the world. We are only now beginning to understand how virus and mosquito genetics influence vector infection and virus transmission to a host. In this proposal we will develop new alphavirus-based tools to help us understand the effects of these virus and mosquito genetic factors on infection and transmission. We will develop new methods to track virus transmission from mosquitoes to experimental animals in such a way that the entire transmission cycle may be directly visualized. In this study, we plan to use fluorescent and bioluminescent technology to readily observe and detect alphavirus transmission from mosquitoes to small animals. This grant proposal will use alphavirus transducing systems (ATS's) to develop vector transmission models, identify specific alphavirus/mosquito interactions affecting virus transmission, improve ATS's ability to knock down targeted genes, and develop novel ATS-based biomarkers for mosquito infection.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The respiratory tract is a major portal for pathogens. The bronchoalveolar macrophage, positioned at the mucosal surface, recognizes  pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)  through  pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).  A family of mammalian PRRs,  Toll-like receptors  (TLRs), are transmembrane signaling molecules that respond to diverse PAMPs. Gram negative lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates cells through TLR4 to elicit a strongly proinflammatory pattern of gene expression, resulting in a  Th1-type  cytokine milieu. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants and young children worldwide, and has recently been attributed to increased morbidity and mortality in the elderly and immunosuppressed. The RSV fusion (F) protein is also a TLR4 agonist. Prophylactic administration of anti-F antibodies to high-risk infants is highly protective. In a failed clinical trial in the 1960's, a formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine led to exacerbated RSV disease, findings we have recapitulated in the cotton rat (S. hispidus), assessed by pulmonary histopathology and airway hyperreactivity. During the first cycle of this grant, we identified cyclooxygenase-2 and prostanoids as key therapeutic targets for RSV-induced lung pathology. We found that vaccination of cotton rats with the original FI-RSV used in the failed trials, newly formulated with a non-toxic adjuvant and TLR4 agonist, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), suppressed FI-RSV vaccine-enhanced disease by blunting the mixed Th1- and Th2-type  cytokine storm  that is elicited upon RSV infection of vaccinated subjects. In vitro, purified F protein activation of NF-:B and IL-8 secretion in HEK293T cells is TLR4-, MD-2-, and CD14-dependent, and transfectants that express TLR4 proteins with one or both of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), previously associated with LPS-hyporesponsiveness, were significantly less responsive to purified RSV F protein, under conditions of equal TLR expression. Importantly, we identified a highly significant overrepresentation of these TLR4 SNPs in DNA samples derived from a case series of high-risk infants and children with documented RSV infection. These data strongly support our overarching hypothesis that TLR4 plays a central role in the innate immune response to RSV and imply that initial engagement of TLR4 is required for development of a protective, adaptive immune response, rather than a pathological one. This proposal details innovative experimental approaches that will (i) lead to development a safe and effective RSV F protein subunit vaccine, (ii) lead to development of therapeutic intervention strategies based on a characterization of the interaction of F protein with the TLR4/MD-2/CD14 complex and examine the role(s) of TLR4 signaling in RSV infection/protection. It is expected that at the completion of this grant, we will have identified strategies that may lead to development of a RSV vaccine and new therapeutics for mitigating the pathologic host response to RSV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) detects many microbial structures and host  danger signals  during the early phases of the host immune response to infection. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) expresses a protein called  F protein  that stimulates cells using TLR4. We have recently shown that a previously failed vaccine can be made safe and partially protective by including a TLR4-activating agent in the vaccine. Our proposal seeks to test a new subunit vaccine and to identify new ways to treat RSV infection.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with familial surfactant protein-C (SP-C) deficiency develop a progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD) with considerable morbidity, mortality and no effective therapy. Respiratory exacerbation in SP-C deficient patients has been associated with viral infections including Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) indicating that viral infection is a contributing factor to disease. This application is based upon preliminary data demonstrating a novel role for SP-C in innate protection of the lung from viral infection. SP-C deficient mice (Sftpc -/-) have been generated in order to determine the role of SP-C in pulmonary homeostasis. Sftpc -/- mice develop an ILD like disease and are highly susceptible to RSV lung infection with decreased viral clearance and robust and sustained pulmonary inflammation. The increased severity of RSV infection in the Sftpc -/- mice and the impact of viral infection in SP-C deficient patients indicate that SP-C is a significant component of the innate immune system of the lung. A role for SP-C in innate defense is supported by preliminary data showing that SP-C inhibits signaling through toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). This application will determine the role of SP-C in protecting the lung from RSV and will test the central hypothesis that SP-C reduces RSV infectivity and RSV induced inflammation. In Aim1, mechanisms will be identified whereby SP-C reduces viral titers. Experiments will determine if SP-C impedes viral uptake, alters phagocytosis or binds to RSV proteins that mediate attachment and cell entry. In Aim 2, mechanisms will be defined whereby SP-C reduces RSV-induced inflammation. Experiments will test whether SP-C modulates TLR3 activity by regulating TLR3 association and internalization or by regulating intracellular TLR3 signaling events. The site of SP-C and TLR3 interaction and structural motifs on SP-C that regulate TLR3 function will be determined using site specific mutagenesis of SP-C. Aim 3 will identify the pulmonary responses to RSV regulated by SP-C. SP-C will be conditionally expressed in the lungs of Sftpc -/- mice and exogenous SP-C will be delivered to Sftpc -/- mice during infection to establish parameters for correction of RSV induced injury. The proposed studies will identify mechanisms whereby SP-C protects the lung from RSV injury. Data from the translational experiments of Aim 3 will be useful in designing therapy for exacerbations in SP-C deficient patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary surfactant lines the surface of the lung, is essential for normal lung function and protects the lung from infection. People that do not produce normal amounts of the surfactant protein C (SP-C) develop lung disease and are more susceptible to infection by the virus Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). In this application, we propose to determine how SP-C protects the lung against RSV infection and reduces inflammation. We will also determine the conditions where SP-C replacement in the lung will reduce the inflammation and injury from RSV infections. These studies should be useful in designing therapies for treatment of RSV infection in patients that have SP-C deficiency.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We aim to prospectively define how specific genetic, biologic, and immunologic characteristics, along with environmental exposures, interact in children who experience severe RSV bronchiolitis early in life impact the subsequent development of asthma, airway hyperreactivity and allergy. Specifically, we will utilize a well- established cohort of children with severe RSV bronchiolitis that has been prospectively followed since 1998 (RSV Bronchiolitis in Early Life, RBEL-I, n=206), a retrospectively identified cohort of children with severe RSV bronchiolitis (Boston RSV Bronchiolitis cohort, n=200), and test our key findings from RBEL-I in a newly enrolled prospective cohort of infants with severe RSV bronchiolitis (RBEL-II, n=200). These cohorts will be the largest to date, with over 600 children with severe RSV bronchiolitis, and will enable us to test new hypotheses on the causation of asthma and allergic disorders early in life. We will be able to evaluate and confirm over 1500 polymorphisms in candidate genes associated with asthma, airway hyperreactivity, allergic sensitization and RSV susceptibility in three separate populations. We now propose to prospectively test the validity of the newly developed RSV-Asthma Predictive Index (RAPI) in this cohort as well as potentially modify this index to improve its predictive value. We will prospectively evaluate our findings of a dysregulated immune system associated with the development of asthma post-RSV bronchiolitis in RBEL-II. In concert with understanding the biologic and immunologic response of the host during and after severe RSV bronchiolitis, we are now proposing a powerful study of candidate genes associated with susceptibility to RSV and the development of asthma, airway hyperreactivity and allergic sensitization in the combined RBEL and Boston cohorts with over 600 children as well as their parent(s). Given the careful characterization of these children early in life, we will now be able to study potential gene-gene and gene-environment interactions leading to the development of different wheezing phenotypes in childhood. Our overall hypothesis is that children who experience severe RSV bronchiolitis in the context of the appropriate genetic predisposition, have a dysfunctional immune response that predisposes them to develop airway hyperreactivity and asthma. Accordingly, we propose to: Aim I: Evaluate prospectively the validity of a RSV-Asthma Predictive Index (RAPI) on the development of asthma and persistent wheezing following severe RSV bronchiolitis. Aim II: Evaluate prospectively the impact of a dysregulated immune system, specifically dendritic and regulatory T cells, on the development of asthma, persistent wheezing and allergic sensitization following severe RSV bronchiolitis. Aim III: Examine the relationships of ~1500 polymorphisms in genes associated with asthma, atopy, inflammation with the development of asthma, airway hyperreactivity, and allergic sensitization following severe RSV bronchiolitis.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We aim to prospectively define how specific genetic, biologic, and immunologic characteristics, along with environmental exposures, interact in children who experience severe RSV bronchiolitis early in life on the subsequent development of asthma, airway hyperreactivity and allergy. This study will be the largest to date, consisting of over 600 children with severe RSV bronchiolitis, and will enable us to test new hypotheses on the causation of asthma and allergic disorders early in life.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV transmission from infected to uninfected cells is known to be more efficient than infection with cell-free virus. In vitro, cell-cell contact stimulates HIV replication 100-10,000 fold. The ability of HIV to utilize and manipulate cell-cell contact for the purpose of efficient transmission critically contributes to the spreading of infection throughout the body and the progression to AIDS. Cell-associated HIV is also thought to play an important role during sexual as well as mother to child transmissions. Despite its importance, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern contact-dependent cell to cell spread and no antiviral therapy has been directed against this step. Here we propose a team science approach to develop antiviral therapies that specifically prevent HIV cell-to-cell transmission. We will take advantage of the first robust cell-to-cell transmission assay allowing the quantitative measurement of virus spreading from cell to cell. We will apply this assay to isolate host factors required for contact-dependent cell-to-cell transmission. Our comprehensive approach will provide the scientific community with novel candidate genes that have the potential to transform research on the prevention of HIV transmission. We will then use the humanized mouse model for HIV infection to directly test if our identified lead candidate genes are required for the establishment of HIV infection in vivo following mucosal delivery. Finally, a parallel and complementary approach we will identify small molecules that function as novel therapeutics specifically interfering with HIV transmission. Our combined genetic and chemical approach will allow the development of novel preventive therapies that reduce the spreading of AIDS. This research proposal will develop antiviral therapies that target the ability of HIV to efficiently spread from cell to cell. It will first focus on basic science by identifying host genes required for HIV transmission, test their physiological relevance in vivo and initiate a translational approach to isolate small molecule inhibitors that specifically interfere with HIV transmission.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide. It's responsible for approximately 90,000 admissions and $300 million in direct medical costs annually in the U.S. alone. In fact, nearly all children are infected by age 2 years. While most infected children present wi th mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, approximately 1 to 2% develop severe lower respiratory tract disease characterized by tachypnea, hyperinflation, crackles, and expiratory wheezing (i.e., bronchiolitis and pneumonia). However, RSV disease spans the extremes of age as it is also an important cause of outbreaks of respiratory disease in older adults over 65 years of age and in nursing homes and other institutionalized care settings. The overall goal of this project is to use Novavax's Virus- Like Particle (VLP) technology to develop a safe and efficacious RSV vaccine for the prevention of severe lower respiratory tract disease caused by (RSV) types A and B. Several candidates will be developed and evaluated. The primary candidate is anticipated to be a VLP containing the immunologically and structurally important fusion (F) and matrix (M) proteins of RSV produced in baculovirus-infected Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. The Phase I specific aims are 1) to select chimeric RSV VLP candidate immunogens made using F0 from subtype A with or without Ga and Gb from RSV subtypes A and B, respectively. Recombinant chimeric RSV VLPs will be produced in insect or avian cell lines and purified using a process similar to what Novavax has developed for recombinant Influenza VLP vaccines, currently in clinical evaluation; 2) purified VLPs will be characterized, and tested for sterility and purity; 3) RSV VLP will be tested in mice following intramuscular immunization for induction of functional antibody and specific T-cell responses and protection against challenge with live RSV; 4) the lead candidate will be further tested for efficacy and safety (i.e., lack of disease enhancement) in the bovine calf model. Novavax expects to continue development with a Phase II SBRI grant to support completion of process development and GMP manufacturing and testing a candidate RSV VLP vaccine for toxicology studies in preparation for clinical development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide. RSV is also an important cause of outbreaks of respiratory disease in older adults over 65 years of age and in nursing homes and other institutionalized care settings.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Globally, a large majority of HIV-1 infection in women occurs through heterosexual transmission (HST). HST transpires when semen (considered as the principal source for both cell-free (cf) and cell-associated (ca) virus) from an infected male interacts with the female genital mucosa (FGM). Recently, a seminal peptide, denominated as prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), has been identified as a novel player in HIV-1 transmission and infection. The physiological function of PAP is not well understood but has been associated with both fertility and the sperm's motility. Recent studies have demonstrated that seminal amyloid fibrils (SAF) produced by seminal PAP have the ability to enhance the cf-HIV-1 infection by promoting the capture of the virus particles and the subsequent physical interaction of its host target cells in culture, but the role of SAF in ca-HIV-1 infection has not been studied. SAF possess an intrinsic positive charge that neutralizes the repulsive effect between HIV-1 and its target cells. The HIV-1 infection- enhancement effect of SAF has been demonstrated in vitro by infecting tissue culture cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with cf HIV-1 requiring CCR5 and CXCR4 co-receptors. Interestingly, the effect of SAF has been observed to be more pronounced at low viral titers (resembling the in vivo HIV-1 titer in semen). Specifically, this study aims to investigate whether SAF enhances the transmission and infection of both cf and ca HIV-1 in FGM, and the role of female genital secretion (FGS) in this princess. The overall hypothesis of this study is that SAF enhances the transmission and infection of both cf and ca HIV-1 by promoting the physical attachment of the virus to FGM epithelia, thus increasing the subsequent access of the virus to the primary target cells in the stroma and that this process is direct or indirectly blocked or inhibited in the presence of FGS. To address this hypothesis, first we will determine, by using a cervical organ culture, whether cf and ca HIV-1 are transmitted across the FGM at different efficacies and the effect of SAF on the transmission process (Specific Aim 1). After it has been applied to a cervical organ culture, we will then determine whether SAF is present on luminal epithelial cells, or whether it has been incorporated inside the tissue; we will ascertain its effect on the HIV-1 infection of its primary target cells in the stroma (Specific Aim 2). Finally, we plan to determine the role of FGS in SAF activity during the transmission and subsequent infection of FGM with HIV-1 (Specific Aim 3). A better understanding of the role of SAF in HIV-1 infection and transmission within the FGM could lead to the development of new anti-HIV-1 HST-prevention strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through the proposed training, my goal under this fellowship is to complete my PhD at the same time that I get a strong and high qualified scientific expertise in the HIV-1 transmission and infection. This will positioned me as a competitive candidate at the moment of applying for a post-doctoral opportunity in this area. This training will also provide me with the necessary technical tools and practice that will help me develop as a success independent investigator on this field. With the help of this fellowship, the highly qualified laboratory and the broad expertise of my internal and external advisors I feel confident that I will have a successful and productive technical training at the same time that I will improve my writing, communication and reasoning skills. Specifically, my thesis project will contribute to a better understanding of the HIV-1 heterosexual transmission that eventually could be used in the development of more effective preventive strategies. Additionally, I will obtain knowledge and practices in some important and novel techniques such as the development of an organ cervical culture model to study the HIV-1 transmission and infection into the female genital mucosa, simultaneous immuno-phenotyping and in situ hybridization, tissue histology techniques as well as molecular techniques among others. Finally, I expect to publish at least two papers in addition to the three that I already have and present my findings in scientific meetings.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV transmission via breast milk remains a significant mode of infant HIV transmission in the developing world. Interestingly, the majority of infants remain protected from breast milk transmission despite repeated low-dose exposures to the virus, with postnatal transmission occurring in only 10% of HIV-exposed, breastfed infants. This low rate of transmission raises the possibility that HIV-specific immunity in breast milk may protect infants from HIV transmission. We hypothesize that the evolution of compartmentalized virus quasispecies in breast milk is driven by virus-specific, local breast milk immunity. Using the rhesus monkey/SIV model of HIV pathogenesis, we will characterize cellular and humoral virus-specific immune responses and virus co-evolution in breast milk during acute and chronic SIV-infection. We will then investigate whether vaccination with a potent T cell-based vaccine regimen can elicit virus-specific immunity in breast milk. Uninfected, lactating Mamu-A*01+ rhesus monkeys will be vaccinated with plasmid DNA expressing the SIV genes gag, pol, and env, and boosted with a recombinant adenovirus vector expressing SIV gag, pol, and env. Vaccine-elicited SIV-specific cellular and humoral immune responses in breast milk will be examined throughout the vaccination schedule. Mucosal and systemic routes of vaccination will be compared for their ability to induce SIV-specific immune responses in breast milk. Finally, Mamu-A*01-H chronically SIV-infected, lactating rhesus monkeys will be vaccinated with the DNA prime/adenovirus boost regimen by the route that best elicited SIV-specific immune responses in the breast milk of uninfected rhesus monkeys. SIV-specific immune responses and virus replication kinetics in breast milk and blood will be examined in the chronically SIV-infected, lactating rhesus monkeys to determine if vaccine-elicited immune responses can control virus replication in breast milk. These studies will define the impact of virus-specific immunity in breast milk on local virus replication, and will provide a framework for the design of a maternal vaccine as a potential intervention to decrease breast milk transmission of HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As breast milk transmission accounts for nearly one half of the 800,000 infant HIV infections occurring annually, interventions to impede transmission of HIV via breastfeeding are critical. Using the nonhuman primate model of HIV/AIDS, we will determine whether vaccination of lactating mothers can induce virus- specific immune responses in breast milk and reduce breast milk virus load.',\n",
       " 'This program project application brings together a strong multidisciplinary team to study key issues in the virology and immunology of HIV transmission, early pathogenesis, and superinfection during early HIV.The Clinical Core will provide a central resource for the proposed projects by recruiting and followingpersons with acute and early HIV. A unique resource will be enrollment of potential source partners who transmitted HIV. The Clinical Core will be based on an acute/early HIV program that has a strong track record of recruiting persons with acute/early HIV as well as identifying their source partners. In addition to recruitment in the San Francisco area, a second Clinical Core site in southern Brazil will provide additional acute/early infection cases and transmission pairs in an area with a nearly 50/50 mix of subtype B and C HIV, allowing comparisons between HIV subtypes. Four closely integrated studies are planned: Project 1 (Hecht PI) will examine the transmission of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape and drug resistance mutations and their persistence after transmission. It will test the hypotheses that there are not substantial barriers to transmission of drug resistant and CTL escape variants present in source partners, and that differences in viral fitness will predict time to emergence of wild type virus in persons with primary drug resistance or CTL escape mutations. Project 2 (Deeks PI) will examine the role of HIV env properties, in particular co-receptor utilization, during transmission from source to spread partner and evolution following transmission. It will test the role of CCR5 related viral properties, such as receptor binding avidity, in viral transmissibility. It will also investigate the relationship between host CCR5 receptor and ligand genetics and evolution of viral coreceptor properties following HIV transmission. Project 3 (Grant PI) will prospectively follow participants over the first years following HIV infection to better determine the risk of superinfection by time since infection and virologic and humoral immune predictors of susceptibility to superinfection.Project 4 (Nixon PI) will examine the role of HIV specific T-cell responses in driving reversion of CTL escape mutations acquired during HIV transmission to a partner with a different HLA type and the role of CTL responses in superinfection. The Administrative and Analysis Core will provide scientific leadership and data management and statistical support. The overarching aims of this proposal are to advance our understanding of the immunologic and virologic factors that reduce the vulnerability of individuals to superinfection in the first 2-3 years of infection, and to better understand the evolution of HIV as it adapts to a new host environment following transmission. This will provide critical insights into the development of protective immunity following HIV infection, and into the evolution and pathogenesis of HIV in early infection.',\n",

The institution listed isfor the Center, which is not necessarily the institution for the investigator.Sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) accounts for the majority of new infections worldwide. A vaccine capable of preventing sexual transmission across genital or rectal mucosal surfaces could provide a method for stopping the AIDS epidemic. The ultimate success of strategies to prevent sexual transmission of HIV depends, in part, on a better understanding of the virological and immunological mechanisms that underlie sexual transmission. Numerous studies have demonstrated the difficulty to achieve sterile protection from vaginally or rectally acquired HIV/SIV using parenteral immunization. Mucosal immunization is seen as the best approach to achieve sustainable immune responses at mucosal sites of viral entry. Defining the mechanisms of vaginal HIV transmission, in particular the initial immune response is central to the development of effective strategies to develop a successful mucosal AIDS vaccine. Our knowledge of the initial target cells involved in mucosal transmission is still evolving. Increasing evidence suggests that the initial site of productive infection occurs in situ at the mucosal surface. Studies of vaginal transmission suggest that the potential initial target cell may be either activated CD4+ T cells or intraepithelial dendritic cells. Precise dissection of viral targets and pathways involved in sexual HIV transmission will prove essential to the global effort to develop a protective vaccine. The identification of initial target cells and the ability to elicit and to enhance cellular or humoral immune responses at mucosal sites is likely to be a crucial step in the development of novel vaccines. These questions are extremely difficult to pursue experimentally in humans. In this study we propose to examine in situ viral infection at mucosal portal of entry in the SIV/cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) macaque model using SIV tagged with GFP.  Specific aims will include: 1) To identify the types of cells initially infected (i.e., lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells), their phenotype and function; 2) To investigate the mechanisms, time course, and pathways of viral spread from site of initial infection; and, 3) To explore generation of early mucosal cellular immune response at vaginal site of SIV infection.',\n",

The subproject andinvestigator (PI) may have received primary funding from another NIH source,and thus could be represented in other CRISP entries. The institution listed isfor the Center, which is not necessarily the institution for the investigator.The major goals of this project have been to (1) determine whether sequence variants within gp120 are selected during transmission; (2) determine whether the selection of viral variants reflects the population of virus present in the genital fluids of the donor or a biological restriction of the transmission process; and (3) determine the frequency, kinetics, and the virologic and immunologic ramifications of HIV superinfection in both partners following early infection.  The results of these studies are enhancing our understanding of the heterosexual transmission process and yield novel information that is critical to the design and testing of globally effective vaccine candidates.  We are analyzing HIV-1 virus populations, isolated from both the donor and recipient immediately following a transmission event, in unique cohorts of discordant couples in Rwanda and Zambia. These studies have provided a unique opportunity to investigate the virologic determinants of heterosexual transmission using samples from large, well-characterized discordant couple cohorts that represent two predominant clades (A and C) of HIV-1. Recent studies show clade C but not clade A viruses, which establish infection, encode a more compact Env protein compared to donor derived quasispecies.  The viral transmission is primarily monophyletic, but inflammatory genital infections are often associated with the transmission of multiple quasispecies, suggesting an intact mucosa represents a strong barrier to infection. Env isolated from both partners showed strong requirements for both CD4 and CCR5 receptors, but enhanced infection of cells with low receptor/coreceptor levels does not occur with more compact Envs as hypothesized. Phylogenetic analysis shows transmitted viruses do not correspond to more abundant quasispecies in donor genital tracks, but instead represent minor species.  Finally, superinfection was detected in 3 of 15 unlinked (transmission outside marriage) couples suggesting an opportunity for more rapid viral evolution through recombination.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): One ubiquitous and modifiable environmental factor associated with both significant infant morbidity, as well as asthma development, is infant respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. While most children who experience RSV infection have mild symptoms, a significant minority experience more severe disease, often requiring hospitalization and sometimes intensive care. We, and others, have shown that, among children with RSV infection severe enough to require medical attention, the severity of the infection has a strong association with subsequent development and severity of asthma. In addition, we have shown a causal relationship between RSV-attributable infant illness and childhood asthma inception. Because an RSV vaccine is not currently available, RSV immunoprophylaxis is the only currently available alternative approach, licensed for use in preventing RSV-attributable morbidity in high-risk infant groups.  \\tRSV immunoprophylaxis been evaluated in children who experience excessive RSV morbidity. While there have been a number of randomized clinical trials that have enrolled selective populations investing significant resources to ensure adherence that have established  efficacy  (can it work?), the  effectiveness  (does it work?) data are limited and conflicting. No investigations have assessed patterns of use, adherence, and effectiveness in US Medicaid and insured  real world  populations. Neither are there any investigations of the impact of reducing RSV infant morbidity on long-term outcomes such as asthma. These are critically important questions to answer in informing policy for the most costly preventive therapy in pediatrics, and in assessing effectiveness of our only currently available  tool  for decreasing infant RSV morbidity. Lastly, neither are there investigations of the more long-term impact of reducing RSV infant morbidity on the development of asthma, a lifelong chronic disease known to be more common among most groups of children considered high-risk for RSV.  \\tIn three specific aims utilizing two denominator-based study populations of children enrolled in Tennessee Medicaid and six Kaiser Permanente-Northern California integrated medical care practices, we will study infants born between 1995 and 2008 and followed longitudinally to: (1) Determine RSV immunoprophylaxis utilization patterns and adherence; (2) Determine the effectiveness of RSV immunoprophylaxis on RSV hospitalizations and outpatient visits as well as comparative effectiveness with birth timing; and (3) assess the impact of RSV immunoprophylaxis on asthma inception, estimate the effect size, and compare the impact of RSV immunoprophylaxis on asthma inception with the effect we have shown of timing of birth on reducing childhood asthma.',\n",
       " 'Background:  The natural history of asthma begins early in life when infants are exposed to respiratory infections, in particular, those caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).  RSV is the single most important virus causing acute respiratory tract infections in children (bronchiolitis) and is a major cause of severe respiratory morbidity and mortality in the elderly.  Overall, the World Health Organization estimates that RSV is responsible for 64 million clinical infections and 160,000 deaths annually worldwide.  No vaccine or specific antiviral therapy is currently available to prevent or treat RSV infections and natural immunity is of short duration; thus, repeated infections occur throughout adult life.  Despite epidemiologic evidence that RSV infections in early life are linked to both the development and the severity of asthma, the pathophysiology of this association is not currently understood.  An important consideration is that about 30% of children hospitalized for acute RSV bronchiolitis will have recurrent respiratory symptoms consistent with airway hyper-reactivity in the years following infection.  Thus, the clinical severity of the first episode of RSV infection appears to be a critical determinant of subsequent wheezing.  Unfortunately, immunological or biochemical markers of disease severity or predictors of asthma development following primary RSV infection have not been identified so far.  Objectives/Hypothesis:  In a series of studies in vitro and in vivo, we have discovered that in the course of RSV infections reactive oxygen species (ROS) are rapidly generated but do not contribute to the host (innate) antiviral responses; rather, they cause lung inflammation and clinical disease.  In particular, we have shown that ROS are involved in the signaling transduction pathways that control inducible expression of chemokine and other inflammatory genes in response to RSV infection, yet, blocking ROS production does not significantly increase viral replication in the lung and even decreases viral replication in cells.  Recently, in the course of proteomics studies aimed at profiling global protein expression as biomarkers of disease pathogenesis, we made two important discoveries: (1) RSV potently inhibits the expression of antioxidant enzyme (AOE) genes, including Glutathione S-transferases (GST), Superoxide dismutases (SOD), and catalase; (2) following RSV infection, expression of nuclear NF-E2 related factor-2 (Nrf2), which positively regulates basal and inducible expression of AOE genes, is downregulated both in cells and in the lung while Nrf3, which negatively regulates AOE gene expression, is induced in epithelial cells.  Our general hypothesis is that ROS production, along with the inhibition of cytoprotective AOE expression, leads to severe manifestations of RSV infection.  Specific Aims and Study Design:  To test this hypothesis, we propose a series of studies in a mouse model to first establish the expression profile, kinetics, and cellular source of AOE in the lung following experimental RSV infection (Aim 1a).  To test our specific hypothesis that RSV inhibits AOE gene transcription by inhibiting Nrf2 expression and/or activating Nrf3 we will perform western blot and EMSA studies of total lung or cell-specific nuclear proteins (Aim 1b).  We will then test the specific hypothesis that increasing the lung/airway antioxidant capacity, either by activating Nrf-2-ARE-mediated expression of endogenous AOE genes (Aim 2a) or by providing exogenous synthetic antioxidants mimetics (Aim 2b) may be used as a pharmacologic strategy to treat RSV infections.  Thus, using the mouse model we will determine, by established clinical-like parameters and pathophysiologic endpoints of airway dysfunction, the effect of such pharmacologic treatments on experimental RSV infection.  Markers of oxidation and oxidative-associated injury will be used as correlates of protection following treatment with Nrf-2 modulating compounds or antioxidants mimetics.  How our hypothesis and experimental studies translate to human disease will be tested in Aim 3, in which we will analyze whether distinct AOE expression profile at the airway mucosal site can discriminate between infants with different severity of illness and/or degree of oxidative-associated injury following naturally-acquired RSV infections.  In Aim 3a, the profile and relative abundance of AOE proteins present in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) collected from infants with RSV infections of different clinical severity will be analyzed by western blots.  NPS will also be tested for a panel of oxidative stress markers.  In Aim 3b, we will apply our novel biofluids fractionation platform to analyze the NPS proteome by 2D SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectroscopy.  These studies will determine whether viral-mediated inhibition of AOE expression, which we discovered in epithelial cells and in mouse lung (in preliminary experiments), is associated with the most severe clinical manifestations of RSV infection in children, thus contributing to oxidative injury in the airways.    Impact:  In conclusion, we propose a new molecular pathway by which RSV, and possibly other respiratory viruses, induce lung inflammation, with implication for novel therapeutic strategies of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and virus-triggered precipitation of asthma attacks.',\n",
       " \"Many patients with partial spinal cord injuries and preserved axons may nevertheless have no descending motor or ascending sensory function from segments below the injury.  Only limited functional recovery has been observed in people and rats with partial lesions.  We have recently found that a unilateral hemisection (HX) of the thoracic spinal cord in adult rats induces a failure of transmission to individual motoneurons through the intact axons contralateral to the HX, beginning 1 week after injury and persisting for at least 14 weeks (Arvanian et al., 2009).  Initiation of these physiological deficits coincided with the time when elevated levels of Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in tissue surrounding the HX were maximal.  CSPGs have been proposed to be the main molecular obstacles to the nerve fiber regeneration, and degrading CSPGs by the bacterial enzyme chondroitinase-ABC (Ch'ase) stimulates anatomical plasticity in the damaged spinal cord and encourages functional recovery.  We have recently asked if the elevated level of CSPGs surrounding a spinal cord HX might be involved in the failure of transmission through undamaged axons across from the HX on the other side of the spinal cord.Our preliminary results demonstrate that Ch'ase infusion prevented the post-injury failure of transmission to motoneurons and induced a limited facilitation of functional recovery.  A potential obstacle for the use of Ch'ase is that it acts by removing chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains, and thus it is not specific to individual species of CSPGs.  However, individual CSPGs, such as NG2, aggrecan, neurocan, etc., all show different patterns of regulation after SCI and are known to be involved in many CNS functions.  Therefore, one goal of this project is to identify the role of individual CSPGs in mechanisms underlying transmission failure through survived fibers after chronic SCI.  In order to examine the acute effects of CSPGs, we have recently developed a new electrophysiological technique, which allows us to combine intracellular recording from motoneurons with on-line intraspinal injections of various factors in the living adult rats.  We found that intraspinal injections of NG2 (one CSPG that is up-regulated after injury) depressed axonal conduction through the injection region in a dose-dependent manner (NG2 from Dr. Levine, co-Principal Investigator [PI] and one of the discoverers of NG2 and anti-NG2-antibody).  Similar injections of two other CSPGs, aggrecan and neurocan, had no significant effect.  These results identify a novel acute action of NG2 on synaptic transmission in spinal cord, and suggest that antagonism of NG2 may reverse the failure of synaptic transmission after chronic HX.  Our second goal is to determine if neutralization of NG2, by treatment with anti-NG2-antibody, will prevent transmission failure through the survived fibers and improve recovery of locomotor function during the chronic stage of injury.Specific Aims: 1)  Study acute in vivo effects of individually purified CSPGs, which are up-regulated after SCI, on synaptic transmission to individual motoneurons. 2)  Evaluate the ability of a single infusion of anti-NG2-antibody to restore transmission through survived fibers after acute and chronic hemisection. 3)  Assess if prolonged delivery of anti-NG2-antibody (via osmotic mini-pump or viral vector-mediated gene expression) is a more optimal approach to restore transmission after chronic HX. 4)  Investigate whether the proposed therapy is safe and will improve functional recovery.SA1 research results will enable us to identify and target specific CSPGs that may result in physiologically/ functionally complete chronic SCI despite preservation of axons across from the lesion.  Our study will be first to identify individual CSPGs that may cause transmission failure to individual motoneurons from survived fibers.  Outcomes of SA2 will be the first to reveal the effectiveness of anti-NG2-antibody as a therapeutic approach for preventing/reversing transmission deficits.  While comparing the outcomes from SA2 and SA3 we will determine the optimal time-table for NG2 neutralization, required for improving function after acute and chronic HX lesions.  Moreover, the viral vector expressing anti-NG2-antibody will be first constructed and then examined as a novel therapeutic approach for improving transmission and functional recovery after chronic hemisection injury.  Collaborations between PI and co-PI Dr. Levine and Dr. Bowers are ongoing.\",\n",
       " 'HIV/AIDS is a global pandemic with nearly 33 million individuals living with HIV infection worldwide. The objectives of this project are to define the unique epidemiological, clinical, virologic, and immunologic features of HIV infection in developing countries, to determine the viral kinetics associated with sexual transmission, and to characterize the molecular strains of HIV internationally for infectiousness and progression of disease. We previously reported the results of a randomized clinical trial of circumcision to prevent HIV acquisition among 4,996 men in Uganda. The estimated efficacy of circumcision was 51% after 2 years but has risen to nearly 75% three years later.  In addition to the protective efficacy against HIV acquisition, circumcision also reduced the frequency of genital ulcer by 50%. Since herpes is the predominant cause of genital ulcers, we examined the effect of circumcision on acquisition to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) within the context of this trial. The cumulative probability of HSV-2 seroconversion over two years was 7.8% in the circumcision group compared to 10.3% in the control group with an adjusted estimate of efficacy of 28% (p = 0.008). We also examined the effect of circumcision on human papillomavirus (HPV) in these men. Two years after circumcision, the prevalence of high-risk HPV genotypes was 18.0% in the circumcised men and 27.9% in the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.90; P=0.009). Thus, in addition to decreasing the incidence of HIV infection, male circumcision significantly reduces the incidence of HSV-2 infection and the prevalence of HPV infection, findings that underscore the potential public health benefits of the procedure.  Previous observational studies have also reported an association between male circumcision and reduced risk of transmission to their female partners. We assessed whether circumcision in HIV-infected men would reduce transmission of the virus to female sexual partners among 922 HIV-infected men and their partners in a randomized controlled trial of circumcision in Rakai, Uganda. After two years of follow-up, circumcision of HIV-infected men did not reduce HIV transmission to female partners, and there were no significant differences between the two groups.  However, if circumcised men resumed sex with their partners before complete wound healing there was an increased risk of transmission. Consequently condom use after male circumcision is essential for HIV prevention. In order to explore the biological mechanisms by which the removal of foreskin decreases susceptibility to HIV, we assessed foreskin inflammation associated with HIV and herpes simplex virus type. Foreskin inflammation with infiltration of dendritic cells, CD4 and CD8 T-cells was markedly increased among men with serologic evidence for HSV-2, HIV infection, and significantly increased among those dually infected with HIV and HSV-2.  Stromal inflammation was present in 14% of uninfected men compared to 29.7% in men with HSV-2 alone, 33% in men with HIV alone, and 61% in men with dual infection.  In HIV-infected men, epithelial inflammation was also associated with higher HIV viral load.  Epithelial inflammation was also more frequent among men reporting recent genital ulceration.  In summary, foreskin inflammation is markedly increased among men with genital herpes and is associated with increased susceptibility to HIV infection as well as higher HIV viral load, and may have biological implications for HIV transmission and acquisition in uncircumcised men.   Previous reports have suggested that microbial translocation is a cause of systemic immune activation and chronic HIV infection.  We undertook a study to determine whether microbial translocation may play a significant role in disease progression among HIV-infected individuals in Africa.  Multiple markers for microbial translocation including lipopolysaccharide, endotoxin antibody, and soluble CD14 were assessed among Africans prior to exposure to HIV infection and following infection.  We could not document significant changes in the above markers for microbial translocation during HIV-1 disease progression.  Moreover, circulating immunoreactive cytokine levels either decreased or remained virtually unchanged throughout disease progression.  These data suggested that microbial translocation and subsequent inflammatory immune response do not have a direct causal relationship with HIV disease progression in Africa.  We also examined viral heterogeneity in relationship to disease progression.  In Rakai, Uganda, subtype A, D and A/D recombinants predominate and have different disease characteristics and transmission potential.  In one study we found that 89% of subtype D-infected individuals had clinical dementia compared to only 24% of those infected with subtype A.  Similarly, those infected with subtype D had faster rates of progression whereas subtype A had significantly higher rates of HIV sexual transmission compared to subtype D.  In a related study, we also documented that antiretroviral drug susceptibility also varied among ARV-nave individuals by subtype.  For example, delaviridine hypersusceptibility was more frequent in subtype A than D and efavirenz hypersusceptibility was associated with substitution at codon 11 in HIV-RT in subtype D.  Phenotyping may complement genotyping for analysis of ARV drug susceptibility in populations with non-subtype D HIV infection.   We initiated a study to determine the frequency and transmission patterns of HIV-infected long-term non-progressors (LTNP) in Africa. A retrospective analysis of subjects in Uganda identified 4,813 HIV-infected individuals including 637 HIV seroconverters. Of all HIV-positive subjects, 4% were identified as LTNP defined as being infected for more than seven years with a CD4 cell count above 600 without ARVs. Of the HIV seroconverters, 9.1% were found to be LTNP and 1.4% were identified as HIV elite controllers, i.e., those who had no detectable viral load without ARV treatment. LTNP had significantly lower viral load setpoint than all other seroconverters (p < 0.001). The transmission frequency of HIV from a LTNP to their sex partner was 8.2% (5/61) and three of the five partners progressed to AIDS. In comparison the frequency of HIV transmission in discordant partnerships where the prevalent partner was not an LTNP was 21.9% (159/726) with ten recipients ultimately becoming LTNP. None of the four HIV elite controllers identified in this study transmitted to their partners at any time during follow-up, suggesting that naturally suppressed viral load below detectable levels results in a very low probability of transmission. Thus, LTNP can transmit HIV to their partners although at a significantly lower frequency than that observed among non-LTNP. The finding that transmissions may occur from an LTNP and result in progressive AIDS in the recipient indicates that the host immune response is responsible for predicting those individuals that can either control their virus to undetectable levels or suppress it significantly to slow their progression rate and reduce transmission. These data have implications for the future design of therapeutic vaccines. The significance of these studies is that they provide important epidemiologic, clinical, virologic and immunologic knowledge of HIV infection in developing countries, which can be utilized for monitoring future trends of the epidemic and developing behavioral and biological interventions to prevent further transmission.',\n",
       " 'Psychostimulants increase transmission of the neurotransmitter, dopamine, in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. This action contributes to the rewarding effects of these agents and the initiation of drug abuse. Following continued drug use, enduring changes in brain chemistry are observed within the nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex and other regions of the prefrontal-cortico-striatal loop, a circuit that controls incentive motivation, learning and impulsivity. Increasing evidence suggests that these neuroadaptations lead to the dysregulation of behavior that characterizes addiction. Psychostimulants enhance dopamine transmission by inhibiting the dopamine transporter, a protein that clears dopamine released into the synaptic cleft. By inhibiting dopamine clearance, synaptic and extracellular neurotransmitter concentrations are increased.  We previously provided evidence that synthetic kappa opioid receptor agonists inhibit dopamine transmission within the nucleus accumbens and striatum by decreasing release and facilitating dopamine transporter function. Their coadministration with cocaine attenuates the behavioral and neurochemical effects of this stimulant. We have hypothesized that the cocaine-antagonist like effect of kappa opioid agonists may result from their ability to regulate the dopamine transporter.  At present, however, the cellular mechanism(s) mediating the interaction of kappa opioid receptors with the dopamine transporter is unknown. We have used heterologous expression systems and synaptosomal preparations to begin to address this issue. Live cell imaging of cells co-expressing the kappa opioid receptor and the dopamine transporter revealed that activation of kappa opioid receptors by synthetic agonists produces a rapid and pertussis sensitive up-regulation of transporter function. Similar effects are observed in response to salvinorin A, a naturally occurring, high potency kappa opioid receptor agonist. By examining the effects of agonists in the presence of various kinase inhibitors, we have identified a critical role of a specific kinase in mediating the kappa opioid receptor upregulation of transporter function. Consistent with the presence of consensus sites for this kinase in a restricted location of the transporter, we have found that truncation or single point mutation of the dopamine transporter, so as to remove these sites, results in a loss of kappa opioid receptor regulation of transport. The finding that inhibitors of this kinase microinjected into the nucleus accumbens attenuate the behavioral effects of kappa opioid receptor agonists suggest that activation of this kinase contributes to the pharmacological actions of these agents.  On-going studies seek to elucidate the cellular mechanisms by which KOPr systems regulate monoamine transporters and whether blockade of this regulation attenuates the cocaine-antagonist like actions of KOPr agonists. In studies conducted at the systems level, we have begun to define the role of kappa opioid receptors in regulating dopamine transmission in the prefrontal-cortico-striatal loop. Using microdialysis we have demonstrated that kappa opioid receptor located in the prefrontal cortex tonically inhibit the basal activity of dopamine neurons projecting to this region. Kappa opioid receptors are also located in the ventral tegmental area where they selectively regulate the activity of dopamine neurons projecting to the prefrontal cortex. In contrast, however, to kappa opioid receptors located at the level of the dopamine nerve terminal, kappa opioid receptors located at the level of the cell body are not tonically active. Mu opioid receptors (MOR) are enriched in the ventral tegmental area(VTA),the site of origin of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system. This dopamine system is implicated in mediating the reinforcing effects of natural rewards and drugs of abuse. The VTA is a critical site mediating the rewarding effects of MOR agonists.  MOR activation in this region increases dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens. This action is thought to contribute to the rewarding effect of MOR agonists. Morphological data suggest that MOR are located on non-dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. Intracellular recordings in slice preparations of the VTA revealed that morphine increases the firing rate of dopamine neurons but inhibits the firing rate of non-dopaminergic neurons. Although the identity of the non-dopaminergic neurons was not definitively determined, these findings led to the hypothesis that activation of MOR on GABA neurons inhibits their activity, thereby, decreasing GABA release and disinhibiting VTA DA neurons. As a consequence DA release in the NAc is increased. However, the data upon which this hypothesis is based were obtained in a slice preparation in which connectivity of functional circuits is not preserved. Therefore, question exist as to whether MOR activation affects GABA release in awake animals. Alterations in glutamate transmission are recognized to play an important role in shaping the pattern of DA neuronal activity in the brain.  Only two studies have examined opioid regulation of glutamate transmission in the VTA. In these, slice preparations from halothane or isoflurane anesthetized animals were used. Importantly, however, general anesthetics may affect impulse activity, as well as basal glutamate (and GABA) transmission. To date, studies examining MOR regulation of VTA glutamate transmission in the awake animal are lacking. Furthermore, no studies have simultaneously evaluated the influence of MOR agonists on GABA, glutamate and dopamine transmission in the VTA Using microdialysis in the awake and behaving animal, we have demonstrated that reverse dialysis of a highly selective MOR agonist into the VTA produces a concentration-dependent increase in dialysate DA concentrations. Basal dopamine overflow in the VTA was unaltered in mice lacking the MOR gene confirming this effect results from the specific activation of MOR in this region. In contrast to dopamine, basal GABA overflow in mice lacking the MOR gene was significantly increased, while glutamate overflow was decreased. Intra-VTA perfusion of DAMGO to wildtype mice increased dopamine overflow. GABA concentrations were decreased whereas glutamate concentrations in the VTA were unaltered.  These data provide the first direct demonstration of tonically active MOR systems in the VTA that regulate basal glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in this region. We hypothesize that increased GABAergic neurotransmission following constitutive deletion of MOR is due to the elimination of a tonic inhibitory influence of MOR on GABA neurons in the VTA, whereas decreased glutamatergic neurotransmission in mice lacking the MOR gene is a consequence of intensified GABA tone on glutamatergic neurons and/or terminals. As a consequence, somatodendritic dopamine release is unaltered. Together our findings indicate a critical role of VTA MOR in maintaining an intricate balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs to dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, they provide suggestive evidence that VTA MOR may modulate vulnerability to drugs of abuse by regulating GABA and glutamatergic inputs to dopaminergic neurons. Studies testing this hypothesis are currently in progress.',\n",
       " 'In collaboration with Dr. Fernando Polack (Vanderbilt University) and the Infant Foundation in Buenos Aires, Argentina we recruited a prospective cohort of children aged 0-9 months of age from 5 hospitals in Buenos Aires. The primary clinical outcome is severity of disease (O2 saturation 90% infants with WT TLR4 genotypes.Many patients experience mild symptoms, but some individuals are highly susceptible to RSV infection and exhibit more severe symptoms which may result in hospitalization and sometimes death. The mechanism for differential responses to RSV infection is unknown. To develop a cell model to identify genetic determinants of differential susceptibility to RSV infection in humans.  Lymphoblasts from the Coriell Institutes human variation panels were used. These panels consist of various human lymphoblast cell lines established from multiple donors from a number of different ethnic and racial groups which can be genotyped and profiled for gene expression patterns to provide information on genetic differences that determine differential responses to RSV. Cells were infected with RSV (strain A2) and analyzed at various time-points for levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines using real-time RT-PCR. Infectivity was evaluated by measuring expression of viral genes and proteins using real-time PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. The viral load differed significantly between panels as well as between individuals within panels. Similarly, expression levels of IL-6, TNF-, IFN-, IFN-, and TLR4 differed between panels and individuals within panels in response to infection. Differences were also observed in the kinetics of the cytokine response and viral load. We have developed a novel cell model of RSV disease. Significant inter-individual variation in infectivity and inflammatory response to RSV infection suggests that genetic background is an important determinant of susceptibility to RSV disease. Previous in vivo studies have suggested that RSV susceptibility is a polygenic trait; however, the specific genes regulating this phenotype are not known. The purpose of this study was to use in silico haplotype mapping in mice to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that contain genes that contribute to RSV susceptibility. Thirty-five inbred mouse strains were infected with a single dose of 1x106 plaque forming units of RSV or control and sacrificed 1 and 5 d post-infection (pi). Inflammatory response, lung permeability, pathology, mucus cell metaplasia, and viral load were analyzed and compared among and within all inbred strains. Using in silico mapping, the degree of correlation between the observed phenotypic differences and the genotype of the inbred strains was used to determine candidate QTLs. QTLs with a log P value greater than 3.5 were considered significant.  RSV response phenotypes were distributed continuously across the inbred strains. Futher, the strain distribution patterns varied for each phenotype and time point (i.e., not concordant), suggesting that multiple mechanisms influence RSV susceptibility. Correlation analysis of phenotype relatedness also suggests that the response to RSV at 1 and 5 days pi are independent. In silico haplotype mapping identified phenotype-specific significant QTLs. This study confirms that susceptibility to RSV infection is a complex genetic trait. In silico mapping identified possible chromosomal QTLs for multiple phenotypes, and candidate genes for each.',\n",
       " \"HIV transmission within the body is primarily thought to occur via the direct    interaction of virus positive-cells with uninfected target cells. Virus-positive cells are    comprised of either cells that were previously infected or cells that have captured and    maintained HIV in an infectious form on their cell surface. Impairing the cell-to-cell    transmission of HIV is essential to stopping spread within the body and from person-to-person.    We have constructed immunologically relevant model systems in cell culture to examine the    cell-virus and cell-cell interactions that are required for virus transmission. Blood    dendritic cells (DCs) efficiently capture and transmit HIV to CD4+ T lymphocytes, the main    reservoir of virus infection in the body. DCs serve as immune system sentinels and patrol    mucosal surfaces for invading pathogens to provide early warning to the adaptive immune    system. Mucosal tissue exposure to HIV is the most frequent cause of HIV transmission    worldwide. Because DCs are concentrated at these tissues, it is hypothesized that they are    co-opted by HIV during mucosal transmission to gain access to the lymphatic system and seed    infection of the CD4+ T cell compartment. DC-SIGN is a high-affinity HIV Env receptor    expressed by activated B cells, a subset of blood macrophages, mucosal DCs, and in vitro    differentiated monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). MDDCs and activated B cells treated with    antibodies to DC-SIGN bind less HIV and are less effective in stimulating infection of CD4+ T    cells. In addition, ectopic expression of DC-SIGN in transformed B cells enables efficient HIV    capture and transmission to susceptible target cells. Cell biological analysis has revealed    the concentration of HIV at synaptic junctions after DC contact with CD4+ target cells. It has    been postulated that examination of DC-SIGNmediated HIV transmission by transformed cell lines    could aid in the characterization of these processes. Transformed cells would allow more    extensive biochemical characterization and genetic manipulation of the cellular sorting    machinery, cell signaling processes, and cell-cell adhesion molecules required for synaptic    transfer of HIV. Our group was the first to show the feasibility of modeling DC-SIGN-mediated    transmission using transformed B cells in contrast to other cell types. We have used these    differences to investigate cellular requirements for the DC-SIGN-mediated HIV transmission.    These studies reveal that HIV traffics differently in cells that are permissive and    restrictive to transmission and suggests that other cell factors regulate this process. In the    course of these studies, we have found that GFP-labeled virus-like particles (VLPs) can be    used to monitor the requirements of DC-SIGN- or DC-mediated transmission of HIV. We are now    using VLPs to investigate residues of DC-SIGN required for interaction with HIV Env and to    determine whether cell specific modification of DC-SIGN also regulates these interactions.    These studies will increase our understanding of the cell-to-cell transmission of HIV, and    they could provide the basis for rational design of antiviral drugs that prevent HIV use of    DC-SIGN in virus transmission.

This research will provide critical scientific information to the multiple State and Federal agencies responsible for wildlife and livestock in this region. The specific research objectives are to: (1) determine whether brucellosis prevalence of elk can be reduced on the supplemental feedgrounds of Wyoming using two ecological field manipulations; (2) determine the effects of changing land-ownership, irrigation, predation, and hunting on elk group size distributions and brucellosis prevalence; and (3) estimate the amount of intraspecific brucellosis transmission among elk populations and the interspecific transmission among elk, bison, and cattle using a combination of host and pathogen DNA markers and genomics. The researchers will assess how contact and disease transmission are related to host aggregation, and how host aggregations, in turn, are affected by land-use, habitat, hunting, and predators. The relationship between host density and parasite transmission is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Models predict that when transmission is correlated with host density, there is a host density threshold below which the parasite will be unable to persist as the density is reduced. This forms the basis for using social distancing (such as school closures) to reduce the spread of pandemics. In natural systems, the density-transmission relationship is the justification for strategies such as culling, sterilization, and vaccination, which aim to reduce the density of susceptible individuals. The problem of managing Brucella in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is of direct and immediate importance for wildlife management and conservation in this flagship American ecosystem. The researchers will provide information to natural resource managers through biennual meetings and will disseminate free novel software for genetic analyses of pathogen dynamics. The project also will: provide research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, with a particular goal of recruiting Native American students; foster the participation of scientists in programs with GK-12 teachers and students; and support public outreach through films and podcasts developed by students in the Science and Natural History Filmmaking program at Montana State and through the educational outreach program at Yellowstone National Park.',\n",
       " 'Intellectual Merit:  The proposed project is a strategic study addressing how existing knowledge about women in science and engineering gets transmitted from the producers of the research studies to the consumers of the knowledge. Although a wealth of data and knowledge about women in science and engineering has been produced, this knowledge often fails to reach important intended consumers: working women scientists, students, department chairs, administrators, and all those interested in engaging in productive action to improve the status of women in science and engineering.  The project will explore the key initial dimensions of this problem and will identify blockages and inefficiencies in the current system of transmission of knowledge, as well as promising initiatives and models of transmission. The study of such a flow of knowledge about women in science and engineering is unusual (and even unique)and the potential payoffs are high in both intellectual merit and broader impacts.  The methods involve bibliometric means, individual interviews, and organizational case study analyses in two research steps. The first step characterizes the relevant actors ( nodes ) in the network of transmission: including social scientists, funding agencies, university administrators, science reporters and editors, key committees of professional associations, national organizations for women in science and engineering, and working scientists, instructors, and students. The second step defines what constitutes the connections ( links ) between these actors.  The project will create a description of the transmission zone that, in itself, will be novel, interesting, and useful for the organizations and individuals concerned with the status and conditions of women in science and engineering. Further, it will prepare the bases for a systematic and comprehensive network survey of information flows and their blockages as well as facilitatorsBroader Impacts: The significance of the project lies in its high potential for revealing and understanding both the challenges of, and opportunities for, the transmission of knowledge about women in science and engineering; and for establishing the feasibility of, laying the groundwork for, and heightening the probability of success of a more comprehensive network study of this ?transmission zone? of knowledge.  The EAGER program is the ideal vehicle for this study?as no other existing NSF program is situated to consider such an unusual, exploratory, and high-potential proposal.  By identifying blockages and inefficiencies in the current system of transmission of knowledge, as well as promising initiatives and models of transmission, this study will lay the foundation for making the transmission of knowledge about women in science and engineering more efficient and useful. Furthermore, the study has potentially even broader impact insofar as it may be applicable to the dissemination of scientific knowledge in other areas.',\n",
       " \"The transmission eigenvalue problem has attracted many researchers in the scattering and inverse scattering communities recently. Although simply stated, the problem is not covered by any standard theory of partial differential equations. Numerical treatment of transmission eigenvalues is very limited to date. Effective numerical methods will enhance the understanding of the problem and provide tools for mathematicians and engineers to compute transmission eigenvalues. This proposal aims at robust numerical methods for transmission eigenvalues for the Helmholtz equation and the Maxwell's equations. In particular, the following research topics will be carried out. 1) Iterative methods for the Helmholtz equation. Based on a fourth order reformulation, an associated generalized eigenvalue problem will be solved by the finite element method. Then iterative methods will be applied to search roots of a related algebraic function which turn out to be the transmission eigenvalues. 2) Continuous finite element method for the Maxwell's equations. The transmission eigenvalue problem of the Maxwell's equations will be written in a suitable weak form first. Then the curl conforming edge elements will be used to compute the transmission eigenvalues. 3) Iterative methods for the anisotropic Maxwell's equations. This approach is again based on a forth order reformulation of the transmission eigenvalue  problem of the anisotropic Maxwell's equations. An associated generalized Maxwell's eigenvalue problem will be used to set up an algebraic equation whose roots are the transmission eigenvalues. Then iterative methods can be applied to search the roots of the algebraic equation. It is an extension of the iterative methods for the Helmholtz equation. However, the case for the Maxwell's equations is much more difficult and require additional technical treatment.The proposed research will be a pioneer numerical study on transmission eigenvalues for the Helmholtz equation and the Maxwell's equations. The results are important for the development of mathematical theory for transmission eigenvalues and can be used to compare various estimates in inverse scattering theory.  The proposed research will provide mathematicians and engineers reliable tools to compute transmission eigenvalues. It will lead to new methods for studying the inverse scattering problems such as inverse electromagnetic scattering problem for anisotropic media. Since transmission eigenvalues can be used to estimate material properties of the scattering object, the proposed research has potential usage in non-destructive testing, geophysical applications, medical imaging, etc. For example, it is possible to detect the presence of cavities in the dielectric from the location of the transmission eigenvalues. The numerical results will be disseminated to mathematician for analytical study of transmission eigenvalues and engineers for detection and reconstruction of unknown objects. In addition, successful accomplishment of the proposed project will enhance the research capacity of the university and provide graduate students valuable research opportunities.\",\n",
       " 'Synaptic transmission underlies every aspect of nervous system function. How organisms act, feel, and learn all rely on information transfer between nerve cells through synapses.  Investigators have learned that the communication between neurons is a highly complex process, and that a better understanding of such process requires a multidisciplinary approach and the use of complementary and cutting-edge techniques.  This proposal requests partial support for an international meeting on Synaptic Transmission as part of the Gordon Research Conference series to be held at the University of New England Campus on the US Atlantic coast in Biddeford, Maine during the week of July 25-30, 2010. The broad and long term goal of the conference is to increase our understanding of the fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms of synaptic transmission. The specific aims of this meeting will be to convene 34 speakers that represent critical areas of synaptic transmission research with a total of 140 participants for a five day conference in a relatively isolated setting. The program includes speakers and discussion leaders at various levels of their academic careers. Remarkably, four of the speakers are members of the National Academy of Sciences, and two of them are Nobel Prize awardees in Physiology or Medicine. The GRC on Synaptic Transmission is an ideal venue for discussing major recent advances in the field, bridging across disciplines by bringing together world-class experts in different areas, and fostering future developments by promoting the interaction between senior and junior investigators. The discussions during this meeting will help to identify broad research questions that will define future work in this area and underly most aspects of basal as well as higher-order brain function in a variety of experimental systems.',\n",

The N5242A Microwave Network Analyzer from Agilent Technologies will provide the speed and dynamic range needed to collect massive sets of high-quality microwave data on wave propagation in random systems that will dramatically advance this field. Measurements of the transmission coefficients between a large number of points on the input and output of random sample configurations will allow us to determine the matrices for transmission through random samples and to determine their eigenvalues and eigenstates. This will provide the links between the statistics of field, intensity, total transmission, and transmittance and will thereby bridge the gap between optical transmission and electronic conductance. Among the eigenstates of the transmission matrix for opaque media are states with transmission approaching unity. We will find these states and will thereby be able to probe the interior of random systems. We will also be able to determine the eigenvalues of the underlying electromagnetic quasi-normal modes and their speckle patterns in transmission. This will provide a full description of static and dynamic wave properties and will foster advances in imaging and photonics. The success of this work will strengthen the CUNY Photonic Center established to enhance the technological base of the New York City metropolitan area. Students from local high schools and undergraduates as well as graduate students and a postdoc will utilize this equipment to conduct research at the forefront of the field of transport.

We explore and control our environment and stay in touch with one another via waves. In addition to light and sound, we rely increasingly on electron waves and microwave radiation for communication. The shared wave character of light and electrons is behind the rapid growth of the photonics industry and the promise it holds for continued device miniaturization and increased speed. At the same time, the transport of multiply scattered quantum and classical waves in disordered systems remains a crucial issue in communications and imaging. Important examples of propagation in random media are electron flow in conductors and insulators, light scattering in paint, the atmosphere and biological tissue, and acoustic scattering in the earth's crust. The use of the proposed advance microwave measurement system will allow us to decompose the measured microwave field into the fundamental modes of oscillation of waves of randomly scattering systems. This will provide a full description of the transmission of steady-state and pulsed radiation. We will also find ways to combine incident fields to achieve high transmission through opaque systems. This work will advance the understanding of wave scattering and find applications in electronics, medical imaging, and geological exploration for oil and gas. The availability of the advanced microwave source and detector will strengthen the Photonic Center of the City University of New York established to enhance the technological base of the New York City metropolitan area.

       " 'See instmctions):In this continuation application/progress report for an R37 MERIT Award, the progress on the two majorspecific aims is reviewed. The overall goal of the work is to use HIV-1 sequence diversity to examine thebiological determinants of transmission and pathogenesis. These studies will inform our understanding ofthe transmission and disease processes. The first aim covering the study of samples from an HIV-1 verticaltransmission cohort Is nearing completion. A major feature of the remaining work is to create molecularclones of the env genes from maternal and infant viral populations to test the rote of autologous neutralizingantibodies in vertical transmission. This work will test the hypothesis that a neutralization escape variant isresponsible for vertical transmission. In addition, these studies will reveal the complexity of the virus invertical transmission and provide reagents to study other biological properties of the transmitted virus. Thesecond aim on horizontal transmission is still awaiting the availability of samples from people in acuteinfection from southem Braal. Given progress in the field this aim is now refined to focus on the question ofthe relative fitness of subtype B and subtype C viruses Involved in acute infection and coclrculating in thesame population. This analysis is designed to address the question of whether differences in relative viralfitness play a role in the subtype B and C epidemics. Studies in viral diversity are in part framed by thetechnology available to study that diversity. Two important and complementary technologies for studyingdiversity are the heteroduplex tracking assay (HTA) and the single genome amplification (SGA) approach.The new technology of deep sequencing has not been approriately applied to the study of viral diversity dueto intrinsic problems of PCR resampling. A new strategy will be applied to overcome this problem to allowthe accurate use of this new technology to study viral diversity using HIV as the test case This will provide athird complementary approach to the study of viral diversity. The application of these strategies in ways thatcould inform clinical care will also be explored.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Innate antiviral immunity comprises a host defense mechanism for restricting virus spread. The host cells recognizes invading viruses by specialized receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that can specifically identify pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG like helicase (RLH) receptors (e.g. RIGI and Mda5) are known to recognize virus specific PAMPs for induction of antiviral response mediated by activation of the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3). IRF3 activation results in production of antiviral cytokine interferon-a/¿ (IFN). Recently we identified nucleotide- binding oligomerization domain-2 (NOD2) protein, belonging to the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and leucine-rich-region (LRR) containing family (known as NLRs) of cytoplasmic receptors as a viral PRR. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated that NOD2 can trigger an antiviral response (via activation of IRF3/IFN) following infection with human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV possess single stranded RNA or ssRNA as its genome), the major etiological viral agent causing worldwide pulmonary infections among infants, children and elderly. Therefore the current proposal is aimed at - a) establishing NOD2 as a new viral PRR, b) studying the mechanism of NOD2 activation, c) identifying and characterizing the molecules that act downstream of activated NOD2, and d) investigating the in vivo role of NOD2 during RSV pathogenesis, RSV induced lung inflammation and development of lung disease. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that expression of NOD2 in RSV infected cells results in activation of IRF3/IFN. Further studies revealed that - a) NOD2 can recognize ssRNA to activate IRF3/IFN, and b) mitochondrial outer membrane residing protein IPS-1 (MAVS) may act downstream of NOD2 for activation of IRF3/IFN . Thus, we hypothesize that NOD2 is a new member of viral PRR that can recognize viral ssRNA genome to launch an antiviral response following activation of mitochondrial IPS-1 protein. The hypothesis will be tested by focusing on the following specific aims: Aim # 1. Study the role of NOD2 during antiviral response against RSV - The major question of this aim is - Does NOD2 constitute a viral PRR that can activate IRF3/IFN in infected cells? We will investigate whether NOD2 is involved in IRF3/IFN activation during RSV infection of normal primary human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells. The physiological relevance of NOD2 during host defense against RSV pathogenesis and RSV mediated lung inflammation/disease will also be established by using NOD2 knock-out (KO) mice. Aim # 2. Study the mechanism of NOD2 activation - The major question of this aim is - a) Does NOD2 recognizes ssRNA and interacts with mitochondrial localized IPS-1 to activate IRF3/IFN? This question will be addressed by - a) studying association of NOD2 with ssRNA (RSV genome and synthetic ssRNA) and IPS-1, b) examining NOD2 mediated IRF3/IFN activation in cells lacking IPS-1, and c) identifying the specific NOD2 domain(s) involved in ssRNA recognition and IPS-1 interaction.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects the respiratory tract to cause high mortality and morbidity among infants, children and elderly. Currently, no vaccine or antiviral therapy exists to counteract RSV infection. Our proposed research focused on elucidating the host defense mechanism against RSV infection will be important to understand RSV induced lung disease and viral pathogenesis. The knowledge derived from the proposed studies will be helpful in development of efficient antiviral therapeutics against RSV infection.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Effective prevention strategies for HIV are critically needed, and an effective HIV vaccine is the best long-range hope to dramatically reduce the rate of new HIV infections. To this goal, our current understanding of the biology and epidemiology of HIV transmission remains limited. This Program Project will focus on the identification and systematic evaluation of individuals who have been recently infected with HIV and the sexual partners who transmitted HIV to them (Transmission Pairs) to elucidate and quantify epidemiologic, behavioral, biologic, virologic, and host factors that contribute to transmission.       The San Diego Primary Infection research group has a long and successful history of recruiting acutely and very recently HIV-infected individuals and their transmitting partners. With new approaches to expand our identification of such study participants, as described in the Clinical and Specimen Core, we will address in Project 1 (Transmission Probability): (Aim 1) the transmission probability per contact ((J), (Aim 2) the rate of partner change (c), (Aim 3) the duration of infectious stages (D), and thus determine the reproductive number (R0) of HIV in this population. These investigations will be complemented with Project 2 (Transmission Correlates) that will identify and quantify the contributions of important biologic (Aim 1), viral (Aim 2), and host (Aim 3) correlates of HIV sexual transmission. Most importantly, this research will allow for the accurate estimation of a potential prevention strategy or candidate vaccine's anticipated efficacy based on both an estimation of the target populations' ongoing risk behavior and a thorough understanding of viral and host factors that contribute to HIV transmission. The Administrative Core (Core A) will play a central role in coordinating the administrative, fiscal, data, and statistical support for this Project as well as providing scientific support and facilitating synergistic interaction among investigators and collaborators critical to the success of the interactive projects. The Clinical and Specimen Core (Core B) will identify, recruit and enroll study subjects and collect, process, store, and manage the clinical specimens needed to meet the objectives of the two proposed research projects.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-caused disease represents a significant health care burden worldwide. The RSV infects virtually all children throughout the world in both developed and developing countries. Re-infection is common because natural infection does not induce lasting immunity. Also, severe RSV infections are increasingly occurring among the elderly. In spite of wide-scale efforts to produce an effective vaccine against RSV, no vaccine is yet available.  Development of an inexpensive edible plant-based oral vaccine is an innovative approach for the control of RSV. The present study extends the strategy of using a plant-based oral vaccine to a respiratory pathogen for the first time. Even if lasting immunity is not obtained with the plant-based vaccine, it would be relatively low in cost to use such a vaccine during successive RSV seasons.  We have shown previously that oral immunization of mice with transgenic tomato fruit expressing an RSV- subunit protein, i.e., the F-protein, induces a systemic immune response. This  proof of principle  Phase I study will optimize the expression of the RSV-F protein in the transgenic tomato fruit and determine the capacity of this orally-given antigenic protein to protect against an RSV challenge in two commonly-used models for RSV studies, the Balb/c mouse and the cotton rat. Success will validate the further development of our tomato- based vaccine against RSV and set the stage for a Phase II study. Such a vaccine will definitely make a difference and have an enduring impact on human health.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Respiratory syncytial virus-caused disease is a significant health care burden worldwide, but no vaccine is available. We are developing an inexpensive vaccine using tomato plants to control this virus.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishment of a high throughput screen for the discovery of malaria transmission blocking drugs a major goal of the worldwide malaria eradication program is the reduction and eventual elimination of malaria transmission. In order to achieve this goal, the development of drugs to prevent transmission becomes a high priority and requires new approaches and assays. Herein we propose to develop a small molecule high throughput screen (HTS) focused on preventing the development of gametocytes, the form of malaria that mediates transmission. The goal of this work is the discovery of small molecules that could be developed into transmission blocking drugs. Efforts for the development of vaccines or antimalarial drugs have traditionally targeted the asexual stages of P.falciparum, while virtually neglecting transmission stages. Asexual stages are the proliferative stages during the parasite cycle in the human host, and can reach large numbers (up to 20% of all mature red blood cells in the body may be infected). Asexual development is also linked to the morbidity and mortality of falciparum malaria. However, the emergence of resistance against all currently used drugs (all of which target asexual stages) and unsuccessful attempts to develop vaccines based on asexual blood stage antigens highlight the importance of targeting transmission stages. The global campaign to eradicate malaria, initiated by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation in 2007, has recognized that inhibiting transmission needs to be the top priority if we aim for eradication. There is a major focus on insecticide research, as well as on drugs and vaccines designed to block transmission of malaria from an infected person to additional hosts, by killing the sexual form of the parasite in the bloodstream or preventing maturation of the parasite within the mosquito. Unfortunately, little is known about the biology of transmission stages, and methods for in vitro culture and analysis are limited compared to asexual stage parasites. My laboratory has established a series of crucial technologies for the standardized culture, the detection and the quantification of these stages in vitro. In fact, these technologies enable us to propose the first high throughput assay with a library of 160,000 of chemically diverse compounds for the discovery of compounds that inhibit the development of malaria transmission stages. This project is a collaboration with the Broad Institute, which will be providing expertise in establishment and performance of the assay as well as compound libraries. This is a very important and timely project with great potential to contribute to improved health conditions in malaria endemic countries. Based on the hit rate of a recent whole cell P. falciparum assay (approximately 1%) at our proposed initial compound concentration, we anticipate identification of several hundred to a few thousand compounds that will be further investigated in dose-down screens. In addition, we will perform a microscopic analysis of corresponding parasite phenotypes to identify possible common patterns on growth inhibition or killing. Although beyond the scope of the experiments proposed for this award, lead compounds will be further analyzed in follow up studies such as secondary assays, animal studies, and through mechanism of action studies for target identification. This work will ultimately feed both a pipeline for further development of transmission blocking drugs and our continuous efforts to understand the biology of these elusive yet important parasite stages. A major goal of the worldwide malaria eradication program is the reduction and eventual elimination of malaria transmission.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the most important knowledge gaps in HIV/SIV vaccine research relates to the molecular properties of viruses that are responsible for mucosal transmission and the initial virus-host cell interactions that lead to productive viral infection. The present proposal addresses this priority area by taking advantage of our laboratory's recent discovery of a novel strategy for identifying mucosally transmitted HIV-1 and SIV viral genomes (Keele, PNAS 2008; Keele, J Exp Med 2009). This strategy, based on single genome amplification, sequencing and analysis of plasma viral RNA within the context of a model of random virus evolution, identifies those viruses that are actually responsible for transmission and productive infection. This innovation, in turn, makes possible for the first time the molecular cloning and biological analysis of actual transmitted/founder SIV viruses. In this application, we propose to extend this new approach to the SIV-macaque infection model and to test the following hypothesis: Molecular clones of full-length SIVsmE660 and SIVmac251 viral genomes corresponding to transmitted/founder viruses can be identified, will be shown to be infectious and replication competent, and will recapitulate pathogenic infection in Indian rhesus macaques. Such clones represent novel molecular reagents with which to decipher the earliest virus-host cell interactions responsible for mucosal SIV transmission and can provide new molecularly-defined virus challenge strains for transmission, pathogenesis and vaccine research. Specific aims of the project are organized into R21 (Aims #1-3) and R33 (Aims #4-5) phases amenable to a go/no-go decision. Aims are: 1) To identify transmitted/founder SIVsmE660 and SIVmac251 viruses responsible for establishing productive clinical infection following low-dose mucosal (ir and ivag) inoculation; 2) To molecularly clone full-length transmitted/founder SIVsmE660 and SIVmac251 proviral genomes; 3) To biologically characterize molecular clone-derived SIVsmE660 and SIVmac251 virus strains compared with SIVsmE660 and SIVmac251 virus isolates in vitro with respect to replication efficiency, cell tropism, and envelope phenotype; 4) To determine infectivity, replication kinetics, and pathogenicity of cloned SIVsmE660 and SIVmac251 virus strains in Indian rhesus macaques following low-dose mucosal inoculation; 5) To characterize molecular pathways of virus diversification and adaptation between transmission and the establishment of set-point viremia as a prelude to homologous and heterologous vaccine-challenge studies. Results from these studies promise to shed new light on the molecular basis of mucosal transmission by SIVsmE660 and SIVmac251, identify new potential targets for protective vaccine-elicited immune responses, and provide much needed molecular clones of genetically-diverse, mucosally-transmitted SIV strains for transmission, pathogenesis and vaccine research.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One of the most important knowledge gaps in HIV/AIDS vaccine research relates to the molecular properties of HIV-1 that are responsible for sexual transmission and the initial virus-host cell interactions that lead to productive viral infection. The present proposal takes advantage of our laboratory's recent discovery of a novel method for identifying transmitted HIV-1 viruses and applies this new technology to the discovery and characterization of transmitted simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV). These results will shed new light on the molecular basis of mucosal transmission by SIV in the rhesus macaque model and promise to aide in the identification of new vaccine targets and strategies.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long term goal is to elucidate mechanisms by which respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes lung dysfunction. In the USA, RSV hospitalizes >100K infants/year. Pulmonary mucus is a hallmark of RSV disease. Mucus mixed with epithelial cell debris blocks the airways. Mechanisms by which RSV infection induces airway mucus are not known. Goals of this proposal are to define the role of the viral fusion (F) proteins of mucus-inducing RSV strains in pathogenesis and to define the roles of neutrophils and basophils in RSV-induced mucus.  In contrast to laboratory RSV strains, RSV strains line 19 and 2-20 induce mucus and bronchiolitis in mice. Using a RSV reverse genetics system, we showed that the F protein of line 19 plays a role in mucus induction. We identified five amino acids in the line 19 F protein as candidates for involvement in mucus induction. We will use F mutant viruses to define line 19 F residues that are important for mucus expression in vivo. RSV 2- 20 is virulent in mice. We hypothesize that RSV 2-20 F contributes to airway mucus and virulence. We will define the role of 2-20 F in pathogenesis using 2-20F-chimeric RSV. Line 19 and 2-20 cause greater epithelial cell cytopathic effect (CPE) and desquamation in vivo than lab RSV strains. We will use F mutants to define effects of RSV line 19 F and 2-20 F on epithelial cell CPE, syncytia, and desquamation in vivo and in vitro. We will define the fusogenicity of RSV line 19, 2-20, and lab strain F proteins in epithelial cells in vitro using a fusion assay. We hypothesize that line 19 F and 2-20 F induce greater syncytia and fusion in vivo and in vitro.  The study will also determine the roles of neutrophils and basophils in RSV bronchiolitis. Concurrently wih epithelial cell damage, RSV line 19 and 2-20 induce neutrophilia in the lungs of mice. We hypothesize that neutrophils contribute to viral clearance and mucus expression in line 19 and 2-20 pathogenesis. Line 19- induced mucus is dependent on IL-13, a TH2 cytokine. IL 4 is the primary TH2-driving cytokine. We showed that basophils are the major IL 4-expressing cell type in RSV-infection. We hypothesize that basophils contribute to RSV line 19- and 2-20-induced IL-13 and mucus expression. These RSV bronchiolitis models will advance our understanding of RSV strain-dependent pathogenesis and may lead to much-needed therapies.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RSV causes >100,000 infant hospitalizations in the US each year and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and viral death in infants. Mucus production is a hallmark feature of RSV disease, leading to airway obstruction, hypoxia, and mechanical ventilation. Mechanisms of RSV-induced mucus are unknown and the focus of this proposal. Elucidation of these mechanisms will identify targets for therapies',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this proposal we will study the antiviral mechanism of host cellular innate immunity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). Generally, host cells are able to sense viral components through multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that lead to activation of innate cellular defense responses to combat virus infection. In marked contrast, considerable evidence suggests that, for the most part, HBV does not apparently activate such cellular innate response and this is probably central to viral pathogenesis. Such phenomena indicate HBV infection either is stealth from the detection of the innate PRRs, or HBV has ability to block the innate signal cascades. However, our preliminary evidence shows that HBV replication in human hepatocyte-derived cell lines, such as HepG2 and Huh7, is dramatically inhibited by the innate immune response elicited by expression of PRR adaptors for either Toll-like receptors (TLR), TRIF and MyD88, or adaptor for intracellular RIG-I-like helicases (RLH), IPS-1. Perhaps most surprising is that the inhibition of HBV replication appears to be mediated by intracellular antiviral pathway(s), rather than the secretion of antiviral cytokines such as IFN-1/2. Furthermore, the data suggest that activation of these pathways result in the post-transcriptional degradation of HBV mRNAs. Moreover, we found that activation of NF-:B pathway is essential for all three adaptors to inhibit HBV replication and activation of additional pathway(s) is required for TRIF to induce the maximum antiviral effect. The proposed studies will focus on the molecular mechanism by which the innate immune response inhibits HBV replication. Specifically, the HBV RNA sequence elements responsible for the posttranscriptional RNA decay will be mapped, IPS-1-induced cellular effector molecules that lead to the decay of HBV RNAs will be identified. Understanding of the robust and intricate innate antiviral pathway could potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutics to control HBV infections.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a severe public health problem affecting about 400 million individuals worldwide. Chronic hepatitis B patients have a high risk of occurrence of hepatocirrhosis and liver cancer. Currently approved drugs for treatment of chronic hepatitis B, including alpha interferon, and nucleos(t)ide analogues inhibiting the viral polymerase, are limited by poor response, side effects and emergence of drug resistance. Despite the antiviral drugs, it is very important for the patient to establish the robust innate and acquire immune response to efficiently purge the virus infection. In our effort to understand the innate control of HBV infection, we found that although HBV itself does not activate innate immunity signaling, however the virus is very sensitive to the innate immune responses elicited by the expression of the signal cascades components. Therefore, further study of the molecular mechanism of the innate control of HBV would lead to the better understanding of the virus host interaction and development of novel therapeutics for treatment of hepatitis B.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  One of the primary functions of skeletal muscle is to generate force. Physiological and biomechanical experiments have demonstrated that actin-myosin interaction is responsible for force generation. In order to make movements and perform locomotion, force generated by the activation of muscle fibers has to be transmitted to bony skeleton of the body though tendon. A first step of the force transmission process is to allow force to cross the cellular membrane of the muscle cell. Two pathways have been identified for force transmission: longitudinal (myotendinous), and lateral (myofascial) pathways. Transmitting forces from myofibrils to the tendon laterally involves several anatomical structures, including the myofibrils, the extracellular matrix (ECM), and the lateral linkages between myofibrils and the ECM. Despite some observational evidence for the existence of the lateral transmission of force, the exact mechanisms of lateral transmission and how age-related changes in the structural and mechanical properties of the muscle, tendon and ECM affect it are not well understood. Age-related (young vs. old) structural changes are well document and include changes in collagen content, organization, cross-links, fiber diameter, and the thickness of the ECM. We hypothesize that these age-related changes in the structural properties of the ECM will directly effect the mechanical properties and more important, the lateral transmission of force, and thus be a significant mechanism associated with aging-muscle disability syndromes. The objective of this study is to test this hypothesis by examining the effect of aging on the structure and function of the ECM, and to determine how these changes affect the lateral transmission of force. We will experimentally measure the effect of aging (young vs. old) on the structural and mechanical properties of the ECM of skeletal muscle of the rats. Experiments will be performed to assess the effect of aging on lateral transmission of force. A mathematical mechanical model will be used to determine the mechanisms of role of lateral transmission of force, and the role of ECM. To validate the model, we will compare the results from the experimental measurement and model. Parametric studies using the model will be performed to assess factors that will affect lateral transmission of force, including the structural and mechanical properties of the muscle fibers and the ECM, as well as the interactions between the muscle fibers and the ECM. Successful completion of this proposal will provide new clinical information for the treatment, rehabilitation and training strategies for the elderly, individual's with muscular dystrophy, muscle trauma, and injury and disease associated with ECM abnormities, such as polymyositis and sclerosis    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    The objective of this study is to examine the effect of aging on the structure and function of the ECM, and to determine how these changes affect the lateral transmission of force.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent reports show that young-adult binge drinking has become a major public health problem. Nevertheless, the neurochemistry associated with this type of alcohol misuse has not been extensively studied. Previous radiotracer imaging studies in alcohol dependence have reliably shown that this disorder is associated with a reduction in dopamine type 2/3 (D2/3) receptor binding in addition to a decrease in dopamine transmission of the ventral striatum. Studies in alcohol-preferring rodents show similar results. In addition, functional MRI studies have shown that alcohol dependence is associated with a loss of reward-related activation in the ventral striatum.  The goal of this study is to measure these parameters of dopamine transmission in young- adult binge drinkers compared to control subjects. Using PET radioligand imaging, we will measure both D2/3 receptor binding in addition to changes in extracellular dopamine in response to a psychostimulant challenge. We will also image, for the first time in human subjects, the kappa receptor in vivo. Previous pre-clinical studies suggest that alcohol exposure is associated with an increase in endogenous dynorphin and a downregualtion of the kappa receptor.  All subjects will also undergo an fMRI using the monetary incentive delay task, a task that is associated with decreased ventral striatal activation in alcohol dependence. We will also investigate the correlation between dopamine transmission measured with PET and activation measured with fMRI in the ventral striatum in the same subjects. In addition, this application will explore the correlations between the brain measures obtained, including the correlation between pre-synaptic dopamine function measured with PET and fMRI and the association between kappa receptor availability and dopamine transmission.  It has previously been hypothesized that the decrease in dopamine transmission see in alcohol dependence is associated with a  reward deficiency syndrome . A possible mechanism for this is dynorphin signaling at the kappa receptor. Thus, in this study, we have proposed a set of specific aims that are designed to measure dopamine transmission and reward-related activation with the hypothesis that disruptions in striatal dopamine transmission underlie excessive alcohol consumption in this vulnerable population.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Previous studies have shown deficiencies in the brain neurotransmitter dopamine in alcohol dependence. This decrease in dopamine transmission is thought to play an important role in disruptions in normal reward processing. The goal of the present study is to investigate whether these alterations are present in young-adult binge drinkers, and to investigate potential mechanisms behind the disruptions in dopamine transmission.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the critical importance of chemical synaptic transmission in normal and pathological neural activity, intensive investigation of the underlying mechanisms has long been and remains a primary focus in molecular and cellular neuroscience. Greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of synaptic transmission will be of tremendous value in defining neurological disease processes and developing rational therapies to combat them. The proposed studies build on our recent genetic analysis in Drosophila implicating the DISABLED (DAB) proteins in the synaptic vesicle endocytosis - the process which recycles neurotransmitter filled secretory vesicles after they fuse with the surface membrane and release their contents. In part because DABs are known to play critical roles in sorting surface membrane proteins and have been implicated in major human health conditions including cardiovascular disease, it is exciting to consider another role for these proteins and their molecular mechanisms in synaptic transmission. A function for DABs in sorting synaptic vesicle proteins has not been identified previously, however the proposed studies may now reveal an important synaptic connection for an already intensively studied set of DAB-dependent mechanisms. This project will (1) build on genetic analysis implicating a novel DAB-related mechanism in synaptic transmission to define the functional role of dDAB in the critical process of synaptic vesicle endocytosis and (2) examine the connections between a new function for DAB proteins and previously characterized mechanisms of synaptic vesicle endocytosis to gain a better understanding of the organization and molecular interactions underlying chemical synaptic transmission.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Given the critical importance of chemical synaptic transmission in normal and pathological neural activity, greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of synaptic transmission will be of tremendous value in defining neurological disease processes and developing rational therapies to combat them. The proposed studies are building on exciting discoveries through genetics that are implicating specific genes and proteins and promise to provide new insights into the process of chemical synaptic transmission.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expanding HIV-1 pandemic, and the failure of human efficacy trials of T-cell and antibody-based vaccines, highlight the major gaps in knowledge that must be filled in order to pursue rational HIV-1 vaccine design and development. One of the most important knowledge gaps relates to the precise nature of early virus-host interactions that lead to virus transmission and productive clinical infection. This application is a new HIVRAD proposal by investigators whose recent scientific discoveries relate directly to this priority area of research. These discoveries - the identification of transmitted/founder HIV-1 and SIV genomes (Keele 2008; Keele 2009; Salazar 2009), the identification of genetically-divergent SIVsmm strains in naturally-infected sooty mangabeys (Apetrei 2005; Apetrei 2007), and the identification of innate mucosal immune responses modulating early virus-host interactions (Estes 2006; Estes 2008; Li 2009) - create a unique and timely opportunity to focus three cutting edge research themes on a high priority HIV/SIV vaccine research problem. The current proposal is comprised of three interrelated projects and two cores led by investigators at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (Shaw and Hahn); the University of Pittsburgh (Apetrei and Pandrea); and NCI-Frederick (Estes, Keele and Lifson). Project #1 is  Mucosal transmission and pathogenicity of novel SIVsmm virus strains (Apetrei).  Project #2 is  Identification, cloning and characterization of transmitted/founder SIVsmm (Hahn).  Project #3 is  Molecular analysis of the mucosal SIVsmm transmission bottleneck (Shaw).  Collectively, the projects will test this hypothesis: Identification, molecular cloning, and in vivo analysis of naturally-occurring mucosally-transmitted strains of SIVsmm corresponding to transmitted/founder viruses will reveal viral-host interactions responsible for selective SIV transmission across rectal, vaginal and cervical mucosa and will provide novel, genetically-divergent, pathogenic virus challenge strains for vaccine testing. A key deliverable of this research to the SIV/HIV vaccine field, in addition to new scientific insights into mucosal transmission, will be 18 molecular clones of transmitted/founder viruses representing three widely divergent SIVsmm genetic lineages for use as potential challenge stocks.     RELEVANCE: The expanding HIV-1 pandemic, and the failure of human clinical trials of T-cell and antibody-based vaccines, highlight gaps in scientific knowledge about the initial steps in virus transmission and vaccine approaches to prevent infection. This project will identify and clone new, naturally occurring strains of SIVsmm and will use these to elucidate early infection events in the SIV-rhesus macaque model of human HIV-1 infection.     PROJECT 1:  Title: Mucosal Transmission and Pathogenicity of Novel SIVsmm Virus Strains  Project Leader: Apetrei, C    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of an effective AIDS vaccine remains one of the highest priorities in HIV research. Studies of HIV pathogenesis, vaccine design and antiretroviral treatments require an appropriate animal model. However, the existing SIV/macaque model has major limitations since (i) prototypic SIVmac strains are too pathogenic, (ii) do not represent mucosally transmitted viruses, and (iii) have been extensively passaged in vitro and in vivo. We have recently identified a large set of new SIVsmm strains which mirror HIV-1 group M viruses in their genetic diversity. Moreover, preliminary in vivo results show that infection of RMs with these SIVsmm strains more closely reproduces the natural history of HIV-1 in humans. Within this HIVRAD consortium, we thus propose to use these new SIVsmm strains to generate new (molecularly cloned) challenge viruses for AIDS vaccine and pathogenesis studies. Project 1 will use a dose-escalation strategy to infect 21 Indian rhesus macaques (RMs) with genetically diverse SIVsmm strains using intravenous (iv), intrarectal (ir) and intravaginal (ivag) routes. Project 2 will then employ single genome amplification (SGA) techniques to infer, and subsequently clone, transmitted/founder (T/F) virus(es) from all of these animals. Following detailed in vitro characterization, a subset of clones will be selected for in vivo competition (n=18) and pathogenesis (n=8) studies which will be performed by Project 1. Specific Aims include:     1. To generate high titer plasma stocks of genetically divergent SIVsmm strains without in vitro adaptation for subsequent mucosal and intravenous transmission studies.   2. To infect RMs by intravenous, intrarectal and intravaginal routes with physiologically relevant doses of genetically divergent SIVsmm strains to allow for the identification of transmitted founder (T/F) viruses:   3. To identify SIVsmm clones with, preferential mucosal transmissiblity and replication fitness by conducting an in vivo competition experiment.   4. To characterize the selected SIVsmm clones for in vivo replication kinetics, pathogenicity and suitability as vaccine challenge stocks.     We expect these studies to generate new infectious molecular clones of SIVs with biological properties that more faithfully recapitulate the transmission, pathogenic and diversity of HIV-1 in humans.     RELEVANCE: This project will generate new viral stocks and virological reagents critically needed to elucidate the molecular and cellular events that are responsible for HIV/SIV transmission across rectal and vaginal/cervical mucosa and thus eliminate a major roadblock to AIDS vaccine development.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This proposal requests partial support for an international meeting on Synaptic Transmission as part of the Gordon Research Conference series to be held at the University of New England Campus on the US Atlantic coast in Biddeford, Maine during the week of July 25-30, 2010. The broad and long term goal of the conference is to increase our understanding of the fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms of synaptic transmission. The synapse serves as the basic signaling unit of the nervous system. Synaptic transmission underlies every aspect of brain function and is relevant to most neurological diseases, as well as mental illness and drug addiction. The specific aims of this meeting will be to convene 34 speakers that represent critical areas of synaptic transmission research with a total of 140 participants for a five day conference in a relatively isolated setting. The program will have two keynote lectures and eight sessions that broadly address current issues in transmitter release, postsynaptic signaling and receptor trafficking, short- and long-term plasticity, trans-synaptic signaling, synaptic integration and circuits, local protein synthesis and synaptic function, and a session devoted to the synaptic basis of brain disorders. In addition, two evening poster sessions will permit all participants to contribute to these topics. The significance of this application is that the Gordon Research Conference on Synaptic Transmission is a critical component of the yearly series of conferences that propel research in the international community of  synaptologists . The health relatedness of this application is that the discussions will define the questions that require experimental resolution of a wide range of devastating brain disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, drug addiction, mood disorders and many others, which can collectively be regarded as synaptopathies.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How we think, feel, act and learn, all rely on a process known as synaptic transmission, namely, the information transfer between nerve cells. The health relatedness of this application is that the discussions of current research in synaptic transmission will define the questions that require experimental resolution in areas that affect a wide range of devastating brain disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, mood disorders, autism spectrum disorders, mental retardation and drug addiction. These discussions will focus researchers identifying the mechanisms of synaptic transmission under normal and disease states, and developing therapies based on these mechanisms.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     There is currently no vaccine or standard treatment for RSV. However there is clearly an unmet medical need: RSV is responsible for approximately 100,000 hospitalizations per year in the U.S. alone, and is globally responsible for more than 150,000 deaths per year. The continued absence of vaccines and standard treatments for RSV disease represents an important and serious gap in preventive medicine. In response to RFA AI-09-016, investigators from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc., and Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center are proposing a partnership to expedite RSV vaccine development. Recombinant murine Sendai virus (SeV) expressing RSV F glycoprotein (rSeV-RSV-F) is an extremely attractive candidate for an RSV vaccine. This xenotropic vaccine elicits rapid and durable protection against RSV in an animal model and is associated with no enhanced immunopathology upon RSV infection. Since an RSV vaccine will need to protect infants, and since maternal antibodies can reduce the efficacy of replicating and non-replicating vaccines, fundamental questions concerning vaccine-antibody interactions must be addressed prior to clinical development of rSeV-RSV-F. Our Central Hypothesis is that the rSeV-RSV-F vaccine will confer RSV protection to infants, even in the presence of maternal antibodies. Our Specific Aims are: (1) To determine the relative functional titers of anti-SeV (PIV1) and anti-RSV antibodies in human infants,   (2) To determine the influence of maternal antibodies on rSeV-RSV-F vaccine efficacy (in a cotton rat model), and (3) To optimize vaccine by formulation and regimen. When optimized vaccine doses/formulations/regimens are identified, these will be further tested: (i) to ensure the absence of enhanced immunopathology, (ii) to measure response durability, and (iii) to measure immune correlates of protection. Data from these experiments will have broad application to the pediatric vaccine field, and will be critical to the launch of clinical trials with rSeV-RSV-F.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of severe lower respiratory tract illness in infants and the elderly. Currently, no safe and efficacious RSV vaccine exists. Advances in our understanding of immunity and disease pathogenesis associated with infection have shown that RSV G protein contains a CX3C chemokine motif that interacts with the CX3CR1 chemokine receptor, modifies the activities of CX3CL1, and affects aspects of immunity and disease pathogenesis. Antibodies directed to the CX3C motif inhibit G protein CX3C-CX3CR1 interaction and reduce disease pathogenesis. The long- term goal of our research is to develop a novel nanocapsule vaccine engineered to carry a RSV G protein polypeptide that we have previously shown to induce neutralizing and disease protective antibody. The nanocapsule technology is attractive for vaccine development as it targets professional antigen- presenting cells which we have shown to improve the immunogenicity of both T cell and antibody target epitopes. The proposal will take advantage of well-defined assays and a mouse model to: (1) Identify the optimal CX3C motif vaccine antigen sequence based on G polypeptide vaccination of mice and evaluation of G protein CX3C-CX3CR1 blocking antibody responses, (2) Construct nanocapsule vaccine candidates with the appropriate G polypeptide and demonstrate immunogenicity and protection in a mouse model, (3) Use optimized, efficacious nanocapsule vaccines to further understand the disease modifying effect of antibodies that block G protein CX3C-CX3CR1 interaction and disease pathogenesis, 4) Evaluate parameters of safety and duration of vaccine efficacy in the memory response to (G peptide nanocapsule vaccination and RSV challenge, and (5) Evaluate the safety and efficacy of G peptide nanocapsule vaccine in the context of pre-existing RSV immunity. The proposed research is innovative because it will identify regions in the RSV G protein that induce antibodies which neutralize infection and block RSV disease, incorporate the optimal polypeptide in an novel nanocapsule-based vaccine candidate that targets antigen-presenting cells, and will provide long-term protection against RSV strains. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most important cause of sever lower respiratory tract illness in infants and the elderly. Currently, no safe and efficacious RSV vaccine exists. The long-term goal of our research is to develop a novel nanocapsule vaccine engineered to carry a RSV G protein polypeptide that we have previously shown to induce neutralizing and disease protective antibody.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Women bear the greatest burden of new HIV infections throughout the world. Nevertheless, our understanding of the biology underlying HIV transmission and pathogenesis in women is incomplete. The overarching goal of this PO1 proposal is to unite a dynamic research team with complementary expertise that bridges HIV molecular biology, reproductive biology, immunology, and clinical and epidemiological research to address important, unanswered questions. 1) What sites in the female reproductive tract are most involved in HIV transmission? 2) What HIV properties and host factors critically affect transmission rates? 3) How do endogenous or exogenous sex hormones impact transmission frequency and do these factors modulate innate and adaptive immune responses in the female reproductive tract that counter infection? 4) Why have all tested vaginal microbicides not only failed to stop but often caused paradoxical increases in HIV infection? 5) Can the safety of new microbicide candidates be better assessed before large scale clinical testing? We hypothesize that 1) the upper female reproductive tract represents a highly permissive but understudied portal for HIV infection, 2) specific viral (Env) and host (semen peptides) factors importantly influence the success of male-to-female HIV transmission, 3) changes in sex hormone levels (progestin-only contraception) enhance HIV transmission and menopause adversely modulates both mucosal and systemic innate and adaptive immune responses to HIV, and 4) ineffective and unsafe microbicides activate common patterns of gene expression in the upper female reproductive tract, creating a cellular milieu that favors HIV transmission. Identification of these genes will permit construction of a predictive genetic signature for  microbicide harm.  These hypotheses will be tested in three specific aims involving extensive cross-project collaborations. Specific Aim 1: To study viral and host factors regulating male-to-female transmission of HIV in the female upper genital tract (Warner Greene, MD, PhD); Specific Aim 2: To explore the upper female reproductive tract as a portal of HIV transmission and to assess effects of sex steroids and microbicides on these tissues (Linda Giudice, MD, PhD, and Karen Smith-McCune, MD, PhD, and Specific Aim 3: To investigate immunopathogenesis of HIV in the female reproductive tract (Barbara Shacklett, PhD). These studies will be enabled by two essential cores, the Clinical and Data Core (Ruth Greenblatt, MD) and the Administrative Core (Drs. Greene and Greenblatt).   RELEVANCE: Together, these studies promise to greatly extend our understanding of the molecular, cellular, and immunological basis for HIV transmission and pathogenesis in women. This work could also propel future efforts aimed at developing effective biomedical approaches to interdict male-to-female transmission of HIV.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) has emerged as a significant global epidemic and poses a particular threat to HIV-infected persons. Drug-resistant TB disease is predominantly thought to develop as a result of selection pressure for drug-resistant mutant bacilli ( amplified resistance ). Drug-resistant TB disease may also occur, however, from exposure to and infection with a TB strain which is already drug-resistant ( primary transmission ). Transmission of drug-resistant TB strains has been well-described in congregate settings, such as hospitals containing highly immunocompromised patients, but few studies have evaluated population-level transmission of drug-resistant TB, and none have done so in a high HIV prevalence setting. The collision of XDR TB and HIV in South Africa offers a unique, early opportunity to study these dual epidemics, which are anticipated to converge in other countries in the future.  The current global crisis of drug-resistant TB is due to both amplified resistance and primary transmission, although the relative contribution of each is unknown. In Aim 1 of this application, we propose a prospective, population-based, cross-sectional study to determine the proportion of new XDR TB cases which develop due to primary transmission as opposed to amplified resistance in Tugela Ferry district, a rural area of South Africa with exceedingly high rates of XDR TB and HIV co-infection. We hypothesize that over three-quarters of XDR TB cases arise due to primary transmission. In Aim 2, we will combine molecular genotyping with contact tracing and social network analysis to provide insights into the relationships between XDR TB subjects with matching strain genotypes ( clusters ) and the locations where TB transmission may be occurring. We expect to identify that transmission is occurring in not only healthcare, but also community congregate settings. The findings from this study will lead to a better understanding of XDR TB transmission patterns in the Tugela Ferry community, which is critical for targeting interventions to curb the ongoing XDR TB epidemic. The proposed study will be the first to integrate epidemiologic, molecular, and social network analytic methods to study TB transmission in a high HIV prevalence setting.  The interactions between HIV infection and drug-resistant TB have been identified as a priority research area by the NIH and the Federal TB Task Force, specifically epidemiologic research and greater use of genotyping to improve understanding of HIV and drug-resistant TB, and implementation of intensive contact tracing and outbreak investigation. This application will address these issues directly and take place at the epicenter of the convergent epidemics of TB, HIV, and drug-resistant TB in rural South Africa, where our research group has been working since 2002. Continuous, population-level surveillance for XDR TB, including culture and drug-susceptibility testing for all TB suspects in Tugela Ferry district, creates a unique opportunity to study XDR TB transmission.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Effective prevention of XDR TB, a disease characterized by extremely high mortality, especially in HIV-infected patients, is crucial to controlling the current epidemic and will require understanding patterns of transmission in both healthcare and community settings. This study, which combines classic contact investigation with advanced molecular epidemiologic techniques and social network analysis, will examine XDR TB transmission patterns in a high-HIV-prevalent, rural, resource-limited setting. Findings will help improve the health of individuals and communities affected by the XDR TB epidemic and will create an evidence-base to guide sound public health policy for XDR TB disease prevention throughout the developing world.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long range goal of the proposed work is to understand the fundamental relationships between climate and vector-borne pathogen transmission. We will use more than a decade of research and data at multiple scales on the transmission ecology of West Nile virus (WNV) to determine mechanistic relationships of climate on mosquito populations and WNV transmission and the potential impacts of climate change. The proposed work addresses three specific aims: SA1) Determine the broad scale spatio-temporal correlations between rainfall and temperature and West Nile virus incidence in humans, mosquitoes, and birds, while controlling for land use. Use these patterns to generate mechanistic hypotheses about local scale processes generating these correlations.  We will use more than a decade of WNV incidence in birds, mosquitoes, and humans to determine the influence of temperature and rainfall on the length of WNV transmission season, the spatial distribution of WNV, and the intensity of WNV transmission. SA2) Test mechanistic hypotheses about climate-transmission links with laboratory studies and local scale data on temperature, rainfall, host abundance and WNV seroprevalence, and mosquito abundance, feeding patterns, and WNV infection prevalence.  We will perform laboratory studies to determine the influence of temperature on four critical factors in the transmission of vector-borne pathogens: vector competence, developmental rate, longevity, and biting rate of the three dominant WNV mosquito species.  We will use local studies of WNV transmission at 182 sites in 6 regions spanning the east-west and north-south dimensions of the USA to determine the influence of rainfall and temperature on mosquito abundance and the intensity of WNV transmission relative to other factors. SA3) Use hypotheses supported from SA2 to predict the impacts of climate change on future WNV transmission. We will develop fine scale future climate projections and use the insights gained from aims 1&2 to predict the effects of climate change on the distribution of WNV in North America, the length of the WNV transmission season, and the intensity of transmission across the USA.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Climate change presents important risks for human health, including, vector-borne, water-borne, and food-borne disease, heat stress, air pollution, extreme weather events. The impact of climate on vector-borne disease is one of the more difficult issues to address, because increasing temperature and changes in rainfall can have both positive and negative impacts on pathogen transmission, making simple directional predictions tenuous. As a result, determining the impact of climate change on vector-borne disease requires a multi-scale approach where the mechanisms of climate impacts on local scale transmission can determined, followed by a scaling up of these mechanisms to a scale that is relevant for public health. Current and previous work on West Nile virus presents an opportunity to attack the problem head-on with this multi- scale approach, which will facilitate public health intervention for this, and other vector-borne diseases.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long term goal is to develop a safe, effective vaccine to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease. RSV is the leading cause of bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia, respiratory failure, and mechanical ventilation in infants. It causes >120,000 infant hospitalizations per year in the USA and is the leading cause of infant viral death. In the elderly, RSV causes one third of pneumonia hospitalizations. In children and adults, RSV infection is a major cause of acute asthma exacerbations. There is no licensed vaccine. Experimental RSV vaccines including inactivated, live attenuated, subunit, viral-vectored, and DNA have been developed and tested in animal models and small clinical trials. However, these have been largely unsuccessful. Inactivated and subunit vaccines have a history of causing immunopathology. Live attenuated RSV vaccines are safe. However, attenuated RSVs characteristically induce transient/poor immunity like wild-type RSV.  We are developing novel virus-like particle (VLP) RSV vaccines. VLPs are genetically engineered complexes of proteins in a particulate virus-like structure that lacks viral genetic material and therefore cannot replicate. Viral proteins presented as VLPs are highly immunogenic and induce protective humoral, cellular, and mucosal immune responses. We have extensive experience expressing viral proteins on VLPs and evaluating VLP-induced immunity. The RSV fusion (F) and attachment glycoprotein (G) contain all known neutralizing antibody epitopes and several T cell epitopes. We hypothesize that VLPs expressing RSV F, G, or both F and G surface will induce strong RSV-specific immune responses and immunity.  In Aim 1, we will generate VLPs using a recombinant baculovirus system to express VLP proteins in insect cells and gradient ultracentrifugation to purify VLPs. We have experience with these methods which are FDA approved for human use and scalable for production. We will generate RSV-G, RSV-F, and RSV-GF VLPs by co-expressing these proteins with influenza matrix M1 protein as the VLP core. VLPs co-expressing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) proteins exhibit enhanced cellular and humoral responses. We will generate RSV VLPs with and without anchored GM-CSF. Also, we will optimize immunogenicity by testing three different co-administered adjuvants, aluminum hydroxide (alum), CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN), and monophosphoryl lipid (MPL). The latter two adjuvants stimulate toll- like receptor signaling pathways known to be important for anti-RSV responses. In Aim 2, we will define the immunogenicity and efficacy of these RSV VLP vaccines in a mouse model. Mice will be primed and boosted with VLPs intranasally. RSV-specific antibody (IgG and IgA) and T cell responses will be quantified after immunization. To determine protection, we will challenge mice with a recombinant, chimeric RSV strain known to give higher lung viral loads than laboratory RSV strain in BALB/c mice. Collectively, these experiments will advance RSV VLP vaccine development and may lead to a much needed approved RSV vaccine.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes apprimately 120,000 infant hospitalizations in the US each year and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and viral death in infants. Despite decades of research with traditional vaccine approaches, there are no approved RSV vaccines. We are advancing virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines for RSV, and we predict RSV VLPs will be effective and safe vaccines that prevent RSV disease.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV continues to infect human populations worldwide, emphasizing the need for epidemiological tools that can accurately describe transmission patterns. Thus, the methods we will develop will have specific impact on HIV vaccines; evolution; epidemiological parameters: spread of infection in different groups; intervention; and more generally on the fundamental science of infectious diseases. The overall goal is to understand the relationship between virus evolution and its epidemiological history, and to create epidemiological tools that can make reliable contact tracings and assess changes in epidemic dynamics. We have recently shown that the epidemic rate is inversely correlated to the virus evolutionary rate on the population level. Thus, the specific hypothesis behind the proposed research is that there is a relationship between the speed at which an epidemic moves through a human population and the rate at which the virus evolves in that population. We have observed that there are discrepancies between transmission histories and viral phylogenies, and because the inferences of epidemics are based on phylogenetics, it becomes important to understand the limitations in such inferences. Based on this the specific aims of this proposal are to: 1. Create a model that accurately describes the connection between transmission history and viral phylogeny. Preliminary results suggest that there are  hidden lineages  in viral phylogenies that are involved in transmission events, potentially misleading reconstruction of transmission events. We will especially investigate the effects of the effective population size in the donor, the bottleneck at transmission, and incomplete lineage sorting during transmission and sampling. We aim to estimate meaningful confidence levels on reconstructed person-to-person transmissions enabling us to explore alternative hypotheses in a statistical framework specifically designed for epidemiological tracking. 2. Identify the mechanism that correlates epidemic rate and virus evolutionary rate. We will decipher the connection between epidemic rate and viral evolutionary rate. Currently, we have four alternative explanations that may cause the observed correlation between epidemic and evolutionary rate (host immune selection, viral generation time effects, selection during transmission, and recombination effects). We will use different gene sequence data, codon positions as well as amino acid signatures to discriminate between these hypothetical explanations. We will use large datasets to develop epidemiological models that include these four hypothetical explanations to investigate their effects on the population level, and also model social networks and epidemic and phylogeographic dynamics.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The mathematical methods developed in this project aim to give better inferences of the spread of pathogens, here mainly HIV. At the contact tracing level we will estimate meaningful confidence levels on reconstructed person-to-person transmissions enabling us to explore alternative hypotheses in a statistical framework specifically designed for epidemiological tracking. At the epidemic level we will develop methods that can follow and signal when important changes in spread patterns occur, including the origin of the infection.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mucosal epithelia are the first tissue sites of contact of HIV with the human body during the course of infection, and these play a critical role in determining its success in establishing systemic infection. We have also shown that the efficiency of transcytotic penetration by HIV varies with the degree of stratification of the mucosal epithelium, as well as with the levels of expression of the anti-HIV innate proteins beta-defensin 2 and 3, and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI). We have shown that HIV transmission through mucosal epithelial cells can occur by transcytotic and between epithelial cells by transsynaptic penetration. Spread from epithelial cells to immune cells by transsynaptic transmission may then lead to systemic HIV infection. Transmission through adult mucosal epithelium such as that of the cervix, and across fetal/neonatal oral or intestinal epithelium remain important clinical problems. There are currently no vaccines available to reduce HIV transmission and other preventive approaches such as administering antiretroviral therapy to exposed individuals may not work since neither transcytosis nor transsynaptic transmission require viral replication or fusion of viral membranes with cellular membranes. New methods to reduce HIV transmission across mucosal epithelia are urgently needed, but to develop these methods, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HIV transcytotic and transsynaptic transmission across epithelial surfaces is critical. Accordingly, the specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To determine the mechanisms of transcytotic and transsynaptic spread of HIV through mucosal epithelia; (2) To determine the role of epithelial anti-HIV innate proteins in HIV transmission across mucosal epithelia. The data obtained from this proposal will greatly advance current knowledge about the mechanisms of HV transmission across mucosal epithelia and will open new avenues for designing drugs that may specifically block HIV passage across these epithelia.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV transmission via mucosal epithelium is one of the key initial steps in establishing HIV infection but this process remains poorly understood. This study will characterize the different ways used by HIV to pass through epithelium to infect immune cells, and the various defenses used by epithelial cells to inactivate HIV. Knowledge obtained from these studies may lead to the development of new approaches to prevent HIV infection.',\n",

A unique resource will be enrollment of potential source partners who transmitted HIV. The Clinical Core will be based on an acute/early HIV program that has a strong track record of recruiting persons with acute/early HIV as well as identifying their source partners. In addition to recruitment in the San Francisco area, a second Clinical Core site in southern Brazil will provide additional acute/early infection cases and transmission pairs in an area with a nearly 50/50 mix of subtype B and C HIV, allowing comparisons between HIV subtypes. Four closely integrated studies are planned: Project 1 (Hecht PI) will examine the transmission of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape and drug resistance mutations and their persistence after transmission. It will test the hypotheses that there are not substantial barriers to transmission of drug resistant and CTL escape variants present in source partners, and that differences in viral fitness will predict time to emergence of wild type virus in persons with primary drug resistance or CTL escape mutations. Project 2 (Deeks PI) will examine the role of HIV env properties, in particular co-receptor utilization, during transmission from source to spread partner and evolution following transmission. It will test the role of CCR5 related viral properties, such as receptor binding avidity, in viral transmissibility. It will also investigate the relationship between host CCR5 receptor and ligand genetics and evolution of viral coreceptor properties following HIV transmission. Project 3 (Grant PI) will prospectively follow participants over the first years following HIV infection to better determine the risk of superinfection by time since infection and virologic and humoral immune predictors of susceptibility to superinfection. Project 4 (Nixon PI) will examine the role of HIV specific T-cell responses in driving reversion of CTL escape mutations acquired during HIV transmission to a partner with a different HLA type and the role of CTL responses in superinfection. The Administrative and Analysis Core will provide scientific leadership and data management and statistical support. The overarching aims of this proposal are to advance our understanding of the immunologic and virologic factors that reduce the vulnerability of individuals to superinfection in the first 2-3 years of infection, and to better understand the evolution of HIV as it adapts to a new host environment following transmission. This will provide critical insights into the development of protective immunity following HIV infection, and into the evolution and pathogenesis of HIV in early infection.',\n",
       " \"Effective prevention strategies for HIV are critically needed, and an effective HIV vaccine is the best long-range hope to dramatically reduce the rate of new HIV infections. To this goal, our current understanding of the biology and epidemiology of HIV transmission remains limited. This Program Project will focus on the identification and systematic evaluation of individuals who have been recently infected with HIV and the sexual partners who transmitted HIV to them (Transmission Pairs) to elucidate and quantify epidemiologic, behavioral, biologic, virologic, and host factors that contribute to transmission. The San Diego Primary Infection research group has a long and successful history of recruiting acutely and very recently HIV-infected individuals and their transmitting partners. With new approaches to expand our identification of such study participants, as described in the Clinical and Specimen Core, we will address in Project 1 (Transmission Probability): (Aim 1) the transmission probability per contact ((J), (Aim 2) the rate of partner change (c), (Aim 3) the duration of infectious stages (D), and thus determine the reproductive number (R0) of HIV in this population. These investigations will be complemented with Project 2 (Transmission Correlates) that will identify and quantify the contributions of important biologic (Aim 1), viral (Aim 2), and host (Aim 3) correlates of HIV sexual transmission. Most importantly, this research will allow for the accurate estimation of a potential prevention strategy or candidate vaccine's anticipated efficacy based on both an estimation of the target populations' ongoing risk behavior and a thorough understanding of viral and host factors that contribute to HIV transmission. The Administrative Core (Core A) will play a central role in coordinating the administrative, fiscal, data, and statistical support for this Project as well as providing scientific support and facilitating synergistic interaction among investigators and collaborators critical to the success of the interactive projects. The Clinical and Specimen Core (Core B) will identify, recruit and enroll study subjects and collect, process, store, and manage the clinical specimens needed to meet the objectives of the two proposed research projects.\",\n",
       " 'Although anal intercourse is a common mode of HIV-1 transmission, particularly for men who have sex with men, many fundamental and mechanistic questions remain. The long-term objective of this study is to understand the early events in HIV-1 rectal transmission and to gain new insights, which will potentially lead to new intervention strategies, including vaccines and topical microbicides optimized for rectal use. Studying HIV-1 vaginal transmission in the highly relevant SIV-rhesus macaque model has revealed important events critical for transmission, such as target cell availability, innate immune response, and inflammation at the portal of entry, all factors which play a key role in transmission. Because the anatomical/histological features and the physiological functions of vagina and cervix differ from the rectum, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms and timing of HIV-1 rectal transmission will significantly differ from those of vaginal-cervical transmission. Utilizing innovative approaches and an established conceptual framework from studies of vaginal transmission, we will test this hypothesis by investigating three specific aims: 1) determine the timing, location, spatial distribution and cell types of virus-infected cells at the portal of entry and in draining and distal lymphatic tissues; 2) determine relationships between virus and susceptible target cells (CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells) and between virus-infected cells and the mucosal innate immune response in the rectum shortly after intra-rectal SIV inoculation, thereby determining whether changes in target-cell availability play a critical role in local expansion and systemic spread of infection; and 3) determine the spatial relationships and ratio of virus-specific CD8+ T effector cells (E) and virus-infected-target cells (T) at the portal of entry and in other tissue compartments to extent of control of virus replication, using a novel procedure combining in-situ tetramers and in-situ hybridization The proposed research is significant as it is expected to reveal important mechanisms underlying rectal transmission and potentially provide guidance for designing anti-HIV-1 vaccines and topical microbicides.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early HIV diagnosis is critical for prevention of new HIV infections. Diagnosed patients can limit further transmission and receive medical care that reduces infectivity. Two effective approaches are  population-based screening  and  transmission network targeting.  In healthcare settings, population-based screening is emphasized as a means to test all persons in a defined population, but the vast majority of tests will be negative. In public health and HIV care settings, targeting of transmission networks by testing exposed partners or peer-recruited social contacts is emphasized. This efficiently identifies undiagnosed individuals with fewer negative tests, but misses others not known to be network members. Scarce resources prevent full implementation of either approach, yet partial implementation of multiple complementary and intersecting strategies might be more effective and feasible than full implementation of any one strategy. Demonstrating the implementation and outcomes of such a multi-component screening approach could lead to coordinated allocation of resources on a system-wide basis for maximal impact. The goal of this innovative implementation research proposal is to test whether combinations of screening methods improve the early detection of undiagnosed HIV. We will use population-based screening to identify infected or at-risk patients and then target the transmission networks rendered accessible by those patients. Our emergency department (ED) HIV screening program identifies patients who are: 1) HIV negative but high-risk, 2) known to be HIV positive and engaging in high-risk behavior, and 3) newly diagnosed in the ED as HIV positive. Patients will be asked to provide access to transmission networks. We will then implement an array of multi-component transmission network targeting  packages  in three complementary settings: the ED itself, our HIV treatment center, and our local health department. Package components will focus on: companions present with patients when care is delivered, peer-referral for testing, and health department partner notification. Our specific aims are to measure changes in: 1) number newly diagnosed as a proportion of total tests, and 2) early diagnosis as indicated by median initial CD4 count, that result when we augment an existing population-based ED screening program with comprehensive system-wide transmission network targeting. We will directly characterize the interrelatedness of package components and their capacity to augment one another. By integrating complementary strategies within and across settings, we will inform health policy, promote translation of screening to practice, and demonstrate a means to improve early diagnosis of HIV.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Earlier diagnosis of HIV is critical for prevention. We have effective strategies, but implementation is incomplete. Translation of population-based screening and transmission network targeting in both public health and healthcare settings could be accelerated by a better understanding of the beneficial outcomes of available strategies relative to one another. The fundamental contribution of this study will be to measure the impact of an integrated system-wide approach using the combination of population-based screening and transmission network targeting in public health and healthcare settings.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals and Nutrition Study (BAN), 28 weeks of maternal highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) started at delivery decreased transmission by 52% and 28 weeks of extended infant NVP decreased transmission by 74% over the control arm (sdNVP and 7 days of Combivir). Since adherence, as measured by pill counts or self report, does not capture bioavailability or efficacy of the antiretrovirals, we will measure drug concentrations and plasma and breastmilk viral load (VL) and correlate these data with transmission. Increases in breastmilk HIV VL likely play an important role in breast milk transmission. Possible causes of increases in VL include breast problems (e.g. mastitis or cracked nipples), febrile illnesses, non-adherence to the treatment regimens, or poor bioavailability of the antiretrovirals. Plasma levels of HIV RNA and breastmilk HIV RNA and DNA will be measured and correlated with mastitis, and/or maternal fevers (Specific Aim 1). Drug concentrations in maternal plasma and breastmilk, and infant plasma will be measured (Specific Aim 2), and adherence to study drugs will be determined (Specific Aim 3). Viral loads, drug levels and adherence will be correlated with transmission to the infant. The BAN study did not have an arm that evaluated the combined regimen of both maternal HAART plus extended infant NVP, but data generated in Aims 1-3 will be used to model what this effect might have been (Specific Aim 4). With samples at more frequent time points than most clinical trials, results from this work will be able to determine potential causes of increased breastmilk viral load in women receiving HAART. To understand differential drug penetration more fully, concentration-effect relationships need to be generated. No study has published associations between adherence rates of maternal ART during breastfeeding and the breastmilk concentrations, and ultimately concentrations in the infant plasma; nor has any study evaluated infant prophylaxis adherence based on bottle weights. No data exist to directly estimate the efficacy of combining maternal ART with infant prophylaxis for prevention of breastmilk transmission. In short, no study has used the comprehensive approach of determining associations of measured adherence, antiretroviral concentrations, and VL with breastmilk transmission which this proposal aims to do. Relevance: The data collected through this comprehensive approach will be crucial for the development of strategies that will prevent future breastmilk transmissions, for instance, by improving adherence, or using combination maternal HAART and infant prophylaxis.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals and Nutrition (BAN) Study enrolled 2370 HIV-infected women and their infants to examine different ways to prevent breast milk transmission of HIV. Despite the interventions, some transmissions occurred. We will measure the levels of HIV RNA, HIV DNA, and antiretroviral drug concentrations in plasma and breast milk, as well as determine adherence to study drug regimens in participants from this study to determine why each case of breast milk transmission occurred. We will also review data on cases of maternal fever or breast problems (mastitis, cracked nipples, etc) and correlate these with increases in breast milk viral load and HIV transmission. We will model the potential effect of using combination infant prophylaxis with maternal HAART for the prevention of breast milk transmission of HIV. With these data we will be able to develop strategies that will prevent future transmissions, such as improving adherence, or using combination maternal HAART and infant prophylaxis.',\n",
       " 'This subproject is one of many research subprojects utilizing theresources provided by a Center grant funded by NIH/NCRR. The subproject andinvestigator (PI) may have received primary funding from another NIH source,and thus could be represented in other CRISP entries. The institution listed isfor the Center, which is not necessarily the institution for the investigator.The major goals of this project have been to (1) determine whether sequence variants within gp120 are selected during transmission; (2) determine whether the selection of viral variants reflects the population of virus present in the genital fluids of the donor or a biological restriction of the transmission process; and (3) determine the frequency, kinetics, and the virologic and immunologic ramifications of HIV superinfection in both partners following early infection. The results of these studies are enhancing our understanding of the heterosexual transmission process and yield novel information that is critical to the design and testing of globally effective vaccine candidates. We are analyzing HIV-1 virus populations, isolated from both the donor and recipient immediately following a transmission event, in unique cohorts of discordant couples in Rwanda and Zambia. These studies have provided a unique opportunity to investigate both the virologic determinants of heterosexual transmission as well as the frequency and implications of HIV superinfection using samples from large, well-characterized discordant couple cohorts that represent two predominant clades (A and C) of HIV-1. Recent studies confirm that a severe genetic bottleneck occurs during transmission with a majority of seroconverting partners being infected by a single genetic variant from their spouse, although inflammatory genital infections can increase the number of variants establishing infection. Newly transmitted viruses exhibit a dependence on high levels of both CCR5 and CD4 for entry, and infect macrophages with low efficiency.  Despite compartmentalization of virus variants in the genital tract of both men and women, the viruses that establish infection in the spouse appear to be distinct from these enriched populations  consistent with the bottleneck to transmission occurring at the mucosal surface. Finally, superinfection was detected in 5 of 22 couples where infection occurred outside the marriage and the viruses in each partner are genetically different.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related changes in immune system have long been attributed to the decline in the adaptive immune responses. Now it is becoming increasingly recognized that immunosenescence also involves significant alterations in the function of innate immune system. The impact of advancing age on innate immune responses, however, is difficult to assess due to the limitations of human studies and scarcity of appropriate animal models of immunosenescence. We have previously established an aged cotton rat S.hispidus model of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection. RSV is the primary cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children. Recently RSV has also been recognized as a serious health risk in the elderly. The aged cotton rat model of RSV disease is characterized by delayed viral clearance from the lungs, skewed patterns of pulmonary cytokine expression, alterations in pulmonary recruitment of granulocytes, and neutrophil chemokine imbalance. These changes point to age-related alterations in the function of macrophages (an important source of pro-inflammatory cytokines) and neutrophils (cells implicated in RSV clearance) in the cotton rat model of RSV disease. This proposal will address changes in the innate immune responses to RSV developing with age at the physiological (lung), cellular (macrophages and neutrophils), and molecular (cytokine/chemokine responses including type I interferon) levels using the cotton rat S.hispidus model. Most importantly, we will establish a valuable animal model for studying specific effects of aging on innate immune responses to human viral infections.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the major respiratory viral pathogen of young children and is the primary viral cause of death in infants. Recently RSV has also been recognized as a serious health risk in human elderly. The reasons why RSV disease in the elderly takes on a particularly severe form is not known. We have established an aged cotton rat model of RSV disease which is characterized by delayed viral clearance, skewed cytokine production, and altered cellular inflammatory response to the virus. The cotton rat currently represents the only small animal model for which immunosenescence was shown to affect early antiviral response to RSV. This model will now be explored to define effect of immunosenescence on the innate immune responses to the virus, with particular focus on the role of interferon response and function of macrophages and neutrophils.',\n",
       " \"The respiratory tract is a major portal for pathogens. The bronchoalveolar macrophage, positioned atthe mucosal surface, recognizes  pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)  through  patternrecognition receptors (PRRs).  A family of mammalian PRRs,  Toll-like receptors  (TLRs), aretransmembrane signaling molecules that respond to diverse PAMPs. Gram negative lipopolysaccharide(LPS) stimulates cells through TLR4 to elicit a strongly proinflammatory pattern of gene expression, resultingin a  Th1-type  cytokine milieu. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of pneumonia andbronchiolitis in infants and young children worldwide, and has recently been attributed to increased morbidityand mortality in the elderly and immunosuppressed. The RSV fusion (F) protein is also a TLR4 agonist.Prophylactic administration of anti-F antibodies to high-risk infants is highly protective. In a failed clinical trialin the 1960's, a formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine led to exacerbated RSV disease, findings wehave recapitulated in the cotton rat (S. hispidus), assessed by pulmonary histopathology and airwayhyperreactivity. During the first cycle of this grant, we identified cyclooxygenase-2 and prostanoids as keytherapeutic targets for RSV-induced lung pathology. We found that vaccination of cotton rats with the originalFI-RSV used in the failed trials, newly formulated with a non-toxic adjuvant and TLR4 agonist,monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), suppressed FI-RSV vaccine-enhanced disease by blunting the mixed Th1-and Th2-type  cytokine storm  that is elicited upon RSV infection of vaccinated subjects. In vitro, purified Fprotein activation of NF-¿B and IL-8 secretion in HEK293T cells is TLR4-, MD-2-, and CD14-dependent, andtransfectants that express TLR4 proteins with one or both of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),previously associated with LPS-hyporesponsiveness, were significantly less responsive to purified RSV Fprotein, under conditions of equal TLR expression. Importantly, we identified a highly significantoverrepresentation of these TLR4 SNPs in DNA samples derived from a case series of high-risk infants andchildren with documented RSV infection. These data strongly support our overarching hypothesis thatTLR4 plays a central role in the innate immune response to RSV and imply that initial engagement ofTLR4 is required for development of a protective, adaptive immune response, rather than a pathological one.This proposal details innovative experimental approaches that will (i) lead to development a safe andeffective RSV F protein subunit vaccine, (ii) lead to development of therapeutic intervention strategies basedon a characterization of the interaction of F protein with the TLR4/MD-2/CD14 complex and examine therole(s) of TLR4 signaling in RSV infection/protection. It is expected that at the completion of this grant, wewill have identified strategies that may lead to development of a RSV vaccine and new therapeutics formitigating the pathologic host response to RSV.\",\n",
       " 'Selective transmission of R5 HIV-1 variants, gatekeeping X4 HIV-1. To enter target cells, HIV-1 uses CD4 and a coreceptor that in vivo is either CCR5 (for R5 HIV-variants) or CXCR4 (for X4 HIV-1 variants).  Although both R5 and X4 HIV-1 variants are present in body fluids (semen, blood, cervico-vaginal and rectal secretions), almost exclusively, R5 HIV-1 appears to transmit infection and dominates the early stages of HIV disease.  Moreover, recent sequence analysis showed that a single virus initiates the infection in the majority of cases.  Therefore, there is a gatekeeper that selects R5 over X4 HIV-1 and may operate among R5 HIV-1 variants to select a single variant.  Careful analysis of such potential gatekeeping mechanisms associated with each of the transmission routes shows that they are too imperfect to explain the almost perfect selection of R5 over X4 in HIV transmission.  We suggest that instead of one strong gatekeeper there are many weak ones, whose superimposition is sufficient to protect against X4 HIV-1 infection and potentially select transmittable variants from a pool of R5 HIV-1 variants.  In conclusion, we think that the principle of multiple barriers is more general and not restricted to the protection against X4 HIV-1, but can be applied to other phenomena when one factor has a selective advantage over the other(s).  In the case of gatekeepers for HIV-1 transmission, the task is to identify these factors and to decipher their molecular mechanisms.  The knowledge of the gatekeepers localization and function may enable us to facilitate existing barriers against R5 transmission and to erect new ones against all HIV-1 variants. In general, understanding the gatekeeping mechanisms of HIV-1 transmission is critically important for the development of effective HIV-1-preventive measures (microbicides, virustats, and vaccines).          Experimental study of the early barriers in HIV-1 transmission to cervico-vaginal tissue ex vivo As the cervico-vaginal tissue is the first gateway for HIV-1 during heterosexual transmission, the female lower genital tract may serve as the first gatekeeper, conferring protection against at least some HIV-1 variants.  Using surgical samples of cervico-vaginal tissue (available commercially), we developed an ex vivo system to study HIV male-to-female vaginal transmission, and investigated the gatekeeping mechanisms in this system.  Understanding these mechanisms requires a robust knowledge of the phenotypes, and of the functional features of the cells in the female lower genital mucosa, which are implicated in the early events of HIV-1 transmission. Such knowledge was lacking in the published literature.  Using an original flow-cytometry protocol, we found that in the cervico-vaginal tissue, CD4 and CD8 T cells are predominantly of the highly differentiated effector memory phenotype with a variable pattern of expression of activation markers. The high prevalence of effector memory cells among cervico-vaginal T cells may be critical for the highly efficient defense against various incoming pathogens.  We identified the phenotype, as well as the activation and differentiation status, of CD4 T cells that are preferentially infected by HIV-1 that is transmitted to cervico-vaginal tissue ex vivo. Preferential infection of activated CD38+ CD4 T cells was followed by a similar activation of HIV-1-uninfected bystander cells, creating a vicious circle between R5 HIV-1 replication and the number of cell targets that support this infection.  These results provide new insights into the dependence of HIV-1 infection and the dissemination of the activation of cervico-vaginal lymphocytes.  Remarkably, isolated blocks of cervico-vaginal tissue retain an in vivo gatekeeping mechanism that selects between R5 and X4 HIV-1 infection in spite of the broad expression of both CXCR4 and CCR5, the co receptors for X4 and R5 HV-1.  We attributed the higher susceptibility of cervico-vaginal tissue to R5 HIV-1 infection over X4 HIV-1 infection, to the low abundance of the CD27+ CD28+ effector memory CD4 T cells.  In the system of cervico-vaginal tissue ex vivo, we are now investigating potential barriers that select for the R5 HIV-1 virions that transmit infection through the mucosal barriers.         Determinants of protective barriers among high-risk seronegative personsTheoretical and experimental laboratory evidences of the existence of multiple gatekeeping mechanisms need to be translated into clinical research. Growing epidemiological literature indicates that there are persons who have been exposed to HIV infection but who have remained uninfected. We suggest launching a complex study to investigate the natural barriers of resistance to HIV infection by using a cohort of uninfected persons where the risks for infection are thought to be high. In addition to the 32 base pair deletion in the CCR5 gene which, at the date of this report, is the only mechanism associated with a high protection level from HIV infection, these cohorts will allow the investigation of alternate mechanisms of protection.  According to our concept a number of imperfect gatekeepers contribute to the protection from infection.  Moreover, this protection may not be consistent over time, and may be affected by various factors such as hormonal environment, innate and adaptive immunity as well as the individuals microbiome so that an individual apparently protected for one period of high-risk exposure, may lose this relative protection at other times. A consortium of laboratories including our Section has been established to identify natural gatekeepers in vivo.',\n",
       " 'One of the major foci of research in the Laboratory for Integrative Neuroscience (LIN), Section on Synaptic Pharmacology, is the determination of mechanisms underlying neuromodulation and plasticity and the effects of alcohol and other drugs of abuse on these neuronal functions.  In particular, we are interested in the function of the striatum, a brain region involved in action control and selection, as well as action learning.     We have continued our studies of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) at synapses in striatum. This is a form of long-lasting synaptic plasticity that is thought to contribute to striatal-based learning and memory.  We have been focusing on plasticity involving the neurotransmitters glutamate, dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin), and endocannabinoids.  We have continued to examine LTD induced by exogenous application of 5-HT and endogenous activation of 5-HT release in striatum.  Application of 5-HT produces long-lasting depression of both glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission in striatum. Pharmacological experiments indicate the involvement of 5-HT1B receptors in this form of LTD.  Previous studies had suggested that LTD at glutamtergic synapses involves a decrease in probability of glutamate release, and newer experiments with local photolysis-induced glutamate application indicate no change in postsynaptic responsiveness.  Activation of release of endogenous 5-HT by afferent stimulation combined with application of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibition (SSRI) citalopram also produces 5-HT1b-mediated LTD.  This form of long-lasting synaptic depression could be involved in striatal-based learning, as well as locomotor side effects and other actions of long-term exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other serotonergic drug (including drugs of abuse that target serotonergic synapses).   Ethanol (EtOH) effects on GABAergic synaptic transmission in dorsal striatum (DS) have not been examined in much detail.  Given the prominent EtOH/GABA interactions noted in other brain regions, and the DS role in addiction, it is important to examine this issue.  We have begun performing brain slice experiments recording from neurons in dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatal subregions (DMS and DLS respectively) of EtOH-nave mouse brains.  Our initial results indicate that EtOH inhibits GABAergic inhibitory synaptic transmission in DLS via  presynaptic mechanism, while in DMS we observed potentiation of transmission.  These opposing effects are surprising, and may indicate that EtOH suppresses the output of the DMS that is important for goal-directed actions, while enhancing the output of DLS which is involved in habit formation.  Preliminary data using vibrodissociated neurons from DLS that include pinched-off GABAergic presynaptic terminals indicate that EtOH decreases transmission in this preparation as well.  Thus, EtOH inhibition of GABA release appears to result from a direct action on the axon terminal that does not require factors found in the slice milieu.   It is also important to determine the effect of chronic EtOH exposure on striatal synaptic function, given our interest in the role of this brain region in alcohol intake and addiction.  We have initiated these studies using a vapor chamber inhalational chronic intermittent EtOH (CIE) exposure model in adult mice.  Exposure using the CIE model for 2-4 weeks produces intoxication during exposure, tolerance to EtOH in some behavioral tests, and mild signs of withdrawal/physical dependence such as increased susceptibility to handling-induced convulsions.  It is especially interesting that inhalational exposure for 3-4 weeks produces elevated EtOH consumption.  We are examining striatal synaptic transmission and plasticity in brain slices from CIE-exposed mice.  Preliminary results indicate that CIE exposure decreases GABAergic synaptic transmission in both DLS and DMS.  The chronic EtOH effects in DMS may be homeostatic or indicate tolerance, in that GABA release is increased during acute exposure, but decreased with chronic exposure.  In contrast, chronic EtOH effects on DLS appear to be non-homeostatic in that both acute and chronic EtOH decrease GABA release.  Findings to date indicate no change in glutamatergic synaptic transmission.  Our studies of chronic EtOH effects in mice have revealed synaptic changes that could contribute to prolonged, habitual alcohol use and abuse.  The synaptic changes that we have observed could set up a situation in which depression of inhibitory synaptic transmission may enhance cortical drive that will have a greater influence on DLS output in the CIE-exposed mice.       We have also examined effects of fetal/early-postnatal EtOH exposure on striatal function.  This project was stimulated by reports implicating altered corticostriatal function in humans with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). We are delivering EtOH via inhalation to pregnant mice throughout gestation (E0.5-birth) and to neonates and mothers (P0-10), allowing for stable exposure levels.  The rationale for continuing exposure into the early postnatal period is that development of the striatal circuitry that takes place in utero in humans, occurs in the early postnatal period in rodents.  During neonatal exposure, at vapor levels sufficient to produce the desired levels in the neonates the mothers show no measureable blood alcohol (due to the reduced EtOH metabolism of the pups relative to the mother).  Thus, the mothers are unimpaired by EtOH in this model (nests are intact, pups are well fed).      We are characterizing striatal physiology in the EtOH-exposed offspring starting at postnatal day 0 and continuing into adulthood using a combination of single-cell and slice electrophysiology, immunochemistry and characterization of cell types, as well as behavioral analysis.  We plan to examine effects of EtOH exposure at different fetal and neonatal time points to try to identify critical or sensitive periods for disruption of striatal function.  Brain slice electrophysiological studies conducted to date examining DLS MSNs in >3 month old mice have revealed that GABAergic synaptic transmission is reduced in DLS from EtOH-exposed mice.  It appears that both pre- and postsynaptic function is reduced at the GABAergic DLS synapses.  Thus, our studies will uncover new and interesting information about striatal dysfunction following early-life EtOH exposure.   We have also found effects of fetal/neonatal EtOH exposure on striatal-based behavior.  Adult male mice that were given fetal/neonatal exposure are hyperactive relative to control mice, as seen in FASD sufferers and noted previously in animal models of fetal EtOH actions.  We have examined goal-directed and habitual instrumental learning using a lever-pressing task.  Mice are trained on both random ratio (RR) and random interval (RI) schedules in two slightly different environments.  Mice show reward devaluation in the RR training environment, indicating goal-directed learning, and show no such devaluation in the RI environment, indicating habitual stimulus-response learning.  This parallel training allows the same mouse to be tested in both environments on the same day.  We have now examined the performance of fetal/neonatal EtOH -exposed mice (tested as adults) in this training paradigm.  Surprisingly, mice demonstrated reward devaluation even when trained on the RI schedule that normally fosters habitual responding.  Non-EtOH-exposed mice run at the same time showed no devaluation in the RI environment, similar to normal mice.  Thus, it appears that fetal/neonatal EtOH exposure impairs habit learning.',\n",
       " \"HIV transmission within the body is primarily thought to occur via the direct interaction of virus positive-cells with uninfected target cells. Virus-positive cells are comprised of either cells that were previously infected or cells that have captured and maintained HIV in an infectious form on their cell surface. Impairing the cell-to-cell transmission of HIV is essential to stopping spread within the body and from person-to-person. We have constructed immunologically relevant model systems in cell culture to examine the cell-virus and cell-cell interactions that are required for virus transmission. Blood dendritic cells (DCs) efficiently capture and transmit HIV to CD4+ T lymphocytes, the main reservoir of virus infection in the body. DCs serve as immune system sentinels and patrol mucosal surfaces for invading pathogens to provide early warning to the adaptive immune system. Mucosal tissue exposure to HIV is the most frequent cause of HIV transmission worldwide. Because DCs are concentrated at these tissues, it is hypothesized that they are co-opted by HIV during mucosal transmission to gain access to the lymphatic system and seed infection of the CD4+ T cell compartment. DC-SIGN is a high-affinity HIV Env receptor expressed by activated B cells, a subset of blood macrophages, mucosal DCs, and in vitro differentiated monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). MDDCs and activated B cells treated with antibodies to DC-SIGN bind less HIV and are less effective in stimulating infection of CD4+ T cells. In addition, ectopic expression of DC-SIGN in transformed B cells enables efficient HIV capture and transmission to susceptible target cells. Cell biological analysis has revealed the concentration of HIV at synaptic junctions after DC contact with CD4+ target cells. It has been postulated that examination of DC-SIGN-mediated HIV transmission by transformed cell lines could aid in the characterization of these processes. Transformed cells would allow more extensive biochemical characterization and genetic manipulation of the cellular sorting machinery, cell signaling processes, and cell-cell adhesion molecules required for synaptic transfer of HIV. Our group was the first to show the feasibility of modeling DC-SIGN-mediated transmission using transformed B cells in contrast to other cell types. We have used these differences to investigate cellular requirements for the DC-SIGN-mediated HIV transmission. These studies reveal that HIV traffics differently in cells that are permissive and restrictive to transmission and suggests that other cell factors regulate this process. In the course of these studies, we have found that GFP-labeled virus-like particles (VLPs) can be used to monitor the requirements of DC-SIGN- or DC-mediated transmission of HIV. We are now using VLPs to investigate residues of DC-SIGN required for interaction with HIV Env and to determine whether cell specific modification of DC-SIGN also regulates these interactions. These studies will increase our understanding of the cell-to-cell transmission of HIV, and they could provide the basis for rational design of antiviral drugs that prevent HIV use of DC-SIGN in virus transmission.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, interventions were conducted in an effort to limit transmission, including school closure, vaccination and antiviral prophylaxis. By and large, these approaches were meant to reduce the population level transmission of disease, rather than to protect specific individuals from infection. Using current methods, it is difficult to measure how effective such interventions were. Conducting a randomized controlled trial is difficult due to the unknown timing and location of outbreaks, as well as being ethically problematic. However, quantifying intervention effects is important. Knowing the extent to which transmission is reduced by particular control measures can help us to determine how many cases can be prevented by a particular approach, and whether the approach is sufficient to interrupt (rather than simply reduce) disease spread. Also, interventions are not without both direct and indirect social and financial costs. Deciding whether the effect of an intervention justifies its cost depends on the size of the expected effect and the severity of the disease being prevented. Finally, modern approaches to disease control and public health planning rely extensively on models of disease transmission. These models are only as good as their inputs, one of the most important of which is the effectiveness of any planned intervention. While mechanistic approaches to quantifying intervention effects may be useful, they are assumption laden and could be much improved by measures of the real world reduction in population level transmission provided by these interventions.     The objective of the proposed research is to quantify the effects of interventions on the transmission dynamics of influenza through the development and validation of statistical techniques and enhanced study designs. Specifically, we aim to (1) estimate the effect of prophylactic use of antivirals combined with reactive vaccination on influenza transmission in long term care facilities, (2) estimate the effectiveness of social distancing measures to control influenza transmission in Thailand, and (3) develop and validate enhanced study designs for the investigation of outbreaks of influenza and other pathogens. The methods and techniques used to answer these questions will be widely applicable to other diseases (particularly respiratory viruses), and will provide researchers with new tools to investigate transmission dynamics and identify new methods of disease control.     The proposed research is part of a K22 award. Prior to receiving the award the PI candidate will continue to work in his post-doctoral position under the supervision of Dr. Derek Cummings on research into the understanding and modeling of infectious disease. This research will be conducted under two grants,  Immune landscapes of human influenza in households, towns and cities in southern China  (NIH, 1 R01 TW 0008246-01) and the  Vaccine Modeling Initiative  (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). In his role in the Immune Landscapes project, the applicant will be involved in the collection of serological data on influenza infection from Guang Dong province, China, and the analysis of this data. This work will further his understanding of both the science and practicalities of infectious disease research. In the Vaccine Modeling Initiative, the applicant will work closely with Dr. Cummings and Dr. Bryan Grenfell in an analysis of the effectiveness of reactive vaccination in cholera outbreaks, thereby increasing his abilities in the modeling of infectious disease and the assessment of intervention effects. In addition, the candidate will continue to consult with his mentors Dr. Ron Brookmeyer (on statistical matters), and Dr. Charlotte Gaydos (on laboratory topics and virology). The experience and guidance he receives from this postdoctoral work will leave the candidate well prepared to both succeed in the proposed research and as an independent investigator.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVENCE: An understanding of the dynamics of influenza transmission and the effectiveness of interventions in mitigating it is important due to the threat of emerging pandemic strains as wells as the high burden of endemic disease. This project aims to study the transmission dynamics of influenza and the effect of interventions through the development and application of statistical techniques and novel study designs. This research will provide a direct benefit to public health by estimating the effect of commonly used interventions and fundamental characteristics of influenza transmission.',\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a noncytopathic, hepatotropic DNA virus that causes acute and chronic hepatitis and kills a million people each year from cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently approved therapies for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B include two classes of drugs: interferon and a small number of nucleos(t)ide analogues. However, the indication and response to interferon therapy is poor and associated with severe adverse effects and nucleos(t)ide analogues therapy is frequently associated with the emergence of single- and cross-drug-resistant HBV mutants. Thus, developing a new interferon- and/or nucleos(t)ide analogue-independent therapy is the long-term objective of this application. Antisense-mediated degradation of viral RNA represents such a novel class of antiviral therapy and this approach has been successfully pursued by our collaborator Isis Pharmaceuticals and resulted in a commercialized drug (fomivirsen) targeting cytomegalovirus. Using the same principal, our collaborators at Isis Pharmaceuticals have now identified lead candidate antisense molecules that efficiently inhibit HBV replication in cell culture. Studying the HBV life cycle and its inhibition by antiviral drugs has been and still is hampered by the lack of suitable and widely available in vivo HBV replication and infection systems. I have extensive experience using HBV transgenic mice that express and replicate HBV from an integrated viral genome to study viral gene expression, replication, virus production and inhibition of these steps by interferon-mediated antiviral mechanism. Furthermore, together with our collaborators at the Salk Institute, we have recently demonstrated efficient HBV and hepatitis C virus infection in a novel chimeric mouse model repopulated with human hepatocytes that allows us to study all steps of the viral life cycle during long-term infections. The goal of this application is to use these in vivo HBV replication and infection model systems to further evaluate and improve the therapeutic value and characteristics of the lead candidate antisense molecules targeting HBV. In specific aim 1 we will establish the lead candidate's toxicity and pharmacokinetic profile, demonstrate in vivo activity, and identify the most potent candidates. Specific aim 2 is designed to determine the long-term tolerability and efficacy of the lead candidates in suppressing HBV gene expression and replication in the HBV transgenic mice. In specific aim 3 the antiviral efficacy of the leads and the potential for emergence of drug resistance will be tested in the context of a bonefide HBV infection initiated with a monoclonal viral isolate using human hepatocyte repopulated chimeric mice. Finally, in specific aim 4 we will determine the leads antiviral efficacy against infection with patient sera containing isolates of different HBV genotypes and sera from patients that experienced virological breakthrough on antiviral therapy. Together, these studies will be instrumental in introducing antisense based therapy as a novel approach to combat chronic HBV infection.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Over 350 million people throughout the world are chronically infected by HBV, 15-25% of whom will die from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. The work described in this proposal will exploit current and novel in vivo model systems to discover improved, safe and effective antiviral drugs to alleviate the human suffering and socioeconomic burden of this threat to public health.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to use mathematical modeling to better understand the emergence/re-emergence of dengue fever and similar mosquito-borne diseases and to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies on stopping them. The long term goal of this proposal is to reduce the burden of dengue fever and similar diseases by characterizing transmission to inform models of and response efforts to outbreaks. We intend to deliver a product to these public health officials and policy makers which not only is accurate and predictive, but which utilizes data that is readily available and/or routinely collected (e.g. clinical data, and that from mosquito surveillance programs), as well as a model that is both accessible in use and produces understandable and interpretable outputs. Further, we anticipate our model and outputs to be expandable to other existing vector borne viruses as well as to newly emerging threats not yet identified. Currently existing mathematical models of dengue virus transmission, though add to our understanding of transmission dynamics, are not primarily designed to account for detailed epidemiological prediction and evaluation. Predictive models need to span multiple scales, from house to the community to the international level. Accordingly, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Develop mathematical models of the infection dynamics of DENV in the mosquito and human, 2) Formulate models of the contact dynamics that drive transmission of DENV and 3) Integrate these component models into detailed agent-based simulation models of mosquito-borne transmission. By addressing these aims, we will confront the urgent public health problem of the emergence/re-emergence of dengue and similar viruses, such as chikungunya virus, in the continental US.     RELEVANCE: As no vaccine or treatment is available for dengue virus, mitigating transmission is the first and only line of defense of public health. Adding precision and thus accuracy to known and accepted measures of transmission and ultimately informing a transmission model will allow for quicker, more directed and actionable responses to prevent and/or respond to an outbreak of a vector-borne virus such as dengue.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focuses on penile acquisition of pathogenic SIVsmm infection since this transmission route accounts for nearly half of the global HIV-1 pandemic and has been understudied in comparison with other mucosal routes of transmission. Elucidation of the bottleneck to SIV/HIV transmission and the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying successful infection at epithelial and mucosal surfaces of the penis could be instrumental in the design of effective vaccines. Our laboratories have taken significant steps toward addressing these goals by developing and validating an experimental strategy with which to identify, enumerate, and molecularly clone transmitted/founder HIV-1 and SIV genomes that are responsible for productive infection (Keele 2008; Keele 2009; Salazar 2009; Stone 2010; Bar 2010; Li 2010a,b). In this project, we will test the following hypothesis: Genetically-diverse, rhesus macaque-adapted, pathogenic SIVsmm viruses will productively infect Indian rhesus macaques by atraumatic penile inoculation and lead to persistent replication and pathogenicity. Analysis of transmitted/founder viruses in this transmission model will reveal the extent of the mucosal bottleneck and the impact of neutralizing and binding antibodies on blocking infection. A test of this hypothesis will provide mechanistic insights into the biology of penile SIV/HIV acquisition, the high transmissibility of SIV/HIV during the acute infection period, and the relative protective effect of anti-SIV/HIV antibodies in chronic infection on forward transmission. Specific aims are: (i) To productively infect Indian rhesus macaques by atraumatic penile inoculation of genetically-divergent, macaque-adapted, pathogenic SIVsmm viruses from acute infection plasma; (ii) To identify by single genome amplification and to molecularly clone transmitted/founder viruses from these animals; (iii) To determine if plasma from acutely infected animals contains virus that is more infectious and transmissible on a per virion basis than plasma from the same animals in chronic phase infection; (iv) To characterize quantitatively the bottleneck to penile transmission compared with intravenous inoculation; and (v) To determine if chronic phase plasma contains SIV-specific antibodies that prevent penile or intravenous virus acquisition. A key deliverable of this project, in addition to new scientific insights into penile transmission and mechanisms underlying 'acute- to-acute' infection, will be 8 new molecular clones of transmitted/founder viruses resulting from penile acquisition that represent widely divergent SIVsmm genetic lineages for use as potential vaccine challenge stocks and in further studies of SIV transmission biology.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant):  It is widely believed that a sterilizing HIV or SIV vaccine will need to interrupt the earliest sequence of infection events. This project will develop a new rhesus macaque penile transmission model using genetically-divergent, pathogenic SIVsmm viruses and it will characterize the mucosal bottleneck and determine the vulnerability of early infection events to antibody-mediated protection.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV is primarily transmitted by heterosexual contact and approximately equal numbers of men and women are infected with the virus worldwide. Numerous studies to define the biology of HIV transmission have been undertaken with the goal of identifying stages in the processes from mucosal virus transmission through dissemination to distal lymphoid tissues that can be interrupted by vaccination. To large extent this effort has focused on understanding transmission of HIV to women with little effort define the transmission and dissemination in men exposed to HIV by insertive penile intercourse. We recently developed a reliable model of penile HIV transmission using SIV inoculation of mature male rhesus macaques. This model recapitulates the key virologic and epidemiologic features of HIV transmission in men, i.e. transmission is most efficient in to males when the inoculum is placed into the foreskin rather than simply onto the glans and shaft of the penis; and a single viral variant is found in plasma immediately after transmission (Keele, Miller Unpublished and see Preliminary Studies). We have characterized the virology and immunology of vaginally transmitted SIVmac251 in rhesus monkeys and in this application we propose to conduct parallel studies of penile SIV transmission. The studies will lead to a better understanding of how the HIV is transmitted to males by penile intercourse and the range of antiviral effector mechanisms that are present in the penile mucosal surfaces that are the sites of virus transmission. This information is required to rationally design vaccines to elicit immune responses in the male genital tract that can limit or prevent HIV transmission     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Men are regularly infected by penile HIV transmission and the foreskin seems to be a critical target tissue, because uncircumcised men are at higher risk for HIV infection. Despite this, almost nothing is known about the biology of penile HIV transmission. By defining the virology and immunology of SIV in the male genital we will be provide the biologic basis for attempting to elicit immune responses in these tissues by vaccines.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this proposal we will study the antiviral mechanism of host cellular innate immunity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). Generally, host cells are able to sense viral components through multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that lead to activation of innate cellular defense responses to combat virus infection. In marked contrast, considerable evidence suggests that, for the most part, HBV does not apparently activate such cellular innate response and this is probably central to viral pathogenesis. Such phenomena indicate HBV infection either is stealth from the detection of the innate PRRs, or HBV has ability to block the innate signal cascades. However, our preliminary evidence shows that HBV replication in human hepatocyte-derived cell lines, such as HepG2 and Huh7, is dramatically inhibited by the innate immune response elicited by expression of PRR adaptors for either Toll-like receptors (TLR), TRIF and MyD88, or adaptor for intracellular RIG-I-like helicases (RLH), IPS-1. Perhaps most surprising is that the inhibition of HBV replication appears to be mediated by intracellular antiviral pathway(s), rather than the secretion of antiviral cytokines such as IFN-1/2. Furthermore, the data suggest that activation of these pathways result in the post-transcriptional degradation of HBV mRNAs. Moreover, we found that activation of NF-:B pathway is essential for all three adaptors to inhibit HBV replication and activation of additional pathway(s) is required for TRIF to induce the maximum antiviral effect. The proposed studies will focus on the molecular mechanism by which the innate immune response inhibits HBV replication. Specifically, the HBV RNA sequence elements responsible for the posttranscriptional RNA decay will be mapped, IPS-1-induced cellular effector molecules that lead to the decay of HBV RNAs will be identified. Understanding of the robust and intricate innate antiviral pathway could potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutics to control HBV infections.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today, the majority of new HIV-1 infections result from heterosexual transmission with HIV-1 CCR5-using, R5 strains. However, there is a tight bottleneck during transmission so that only a single virus variant is transmitted in about 80% of infections. It is not known whether the transmitted viruses carry an advantage over strains that fail to transmit. However, R5 envelopes vary extensively in different properties that are likely to have a strong impact on HIV-1 transmission. These properties include (1) macrophage-tropism, (2) capacity to infect cells via low levels of CCR5 and (3) decreased sensitivity to CCR5 ligands including chemokines. Our hypothesis is that HIV-1 transmission is conferred by envelopes with distinct properties that confer an advantage for transmission. We propose the following aims. Aim 1: To investigate whether transmitted founder/acute envelopes form a distinct subset with particular properties: We will investigate HIV-1 R5 clade B and C envs for the three properties described above. We will include envs from the acute stage of infection including founder envelopes that closely represent transmitted strains. We will compare with R5 envelopes from later disease stages that cover the wide variation in the properties to be investigated. Aim 1 experiments will thus reveal whether transmitted founder/acute envelopes form a distinct subset with a particular set of properties. Aim 2: To evaluate whether founder/acute or other R5 envelopes with specific properties confer an enhanced tropism for Langerhan's cells or ectocervical explant cultures as a model for male-to-female transmission: We will investigate the R5 founder/acute envelopes as well as later disease stage envelopes that cover the variation documented in aim 1. These envelopes will be tested for infection of different DC (including LCs) and ectocervical explant cultures and investigated for trans-infection of T-cells via DCs.  Together, these experiments will help elucidate how different env properties impact on transmission. Aim 3: To identify the envelope determinants that confer efficient infection of ectocervical explant cultures: We will map envelope determinants that confer efficient infection of ectocervical explant cultures.  Our proposal will provide the first comprehensive study of how variation in the properties of R5 envs of different clades impacts on their capacity to infect different DC subsets and ectocervical explant cultures as a model for male-to-female transmission. Importantly, we will identify env properties and determinants that confer efficient transmission. The data obtained will provide new insights into the mechanisms of transmission and help identify vulnerabilities in transmitter envelopes that can be targeted by microbicides and vaccines.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our application proposes an extensive investigation into the biological properties of HIV-1 viruses that are transmitted. We will use infection of vaginal and cervical cultures as a model of sexual transmission to evaluate which HIV-1 characteristics confer the most efficient infection. Identification of the viral properties and determinants that confer infection of such cultures will provide new insights into the mechanisms of transmission. Our data will help identify vulnerabilities of transmitting viruses that can be targeted by microbicides and vaccines designed to elicit protection against global HIV-1.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objective of this application is to define the relationship between infant respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and the host response that enables asthma inception. There is abundant evidence that children who experience severe RSV bronchiolitis during infancy are at greater risk for developing asthma later in childhood; however the host and viral determinants of severity of illness are not fully defined. Also unknown is whether mild RSV-induced illness in infancy may protect against the subsequent development of childhood asthma. In Project 1, we utilize the ReSPIRA (Respiratory Study for Protection of Infants from RSV to Asthma) cohort of 2000 infants to focus on host immune responses to RSV infection and the subsequent risk of recurrent wheezing and childhood asthma. Specifically, in Project 1 we will a) establish the relationship between the host phenotypic response to RSV infection in the first 6 months of life and the risk of recurrent wheeze and asthma, and b) identify the host genetic and immune response determinants of the RSV infection phenotype that affect the development of early childhood wheezing and asthma following RSV infection. In Project 2, we will focus on the contribution of specific RSV strains to early childhood wheezing and asthma development. RSV strains isolated from the ReSPIRA cohort will be genotyped and clinical parameters such as bronchiolitis severity score, as well as mediators of the host immune response measured in respiratory secretions will be studied to determine how RSV genotypes impact the host response. In Project 3, we will utilize a mouse model of RSV infection to examine the role of the prostaglandin 12 (PGI2) on airway dysfunction of an RSV strain (01/2-20) that has been associated with severe infant bronchiolitis and which induces airway pathology in the mouse. We previously reported that PG12 and signaling through its receptor (IP) is a critical determinant of severity of illness in RSV strain A2 infection. This project will determine the role of host PGI2 in RSV airway pathogenesis and also determine if a PGI2 analog currently used in the treatment of human disease is a target for RSV bronchiolitis. Further, in Project 3, we will use RSV strains isolated from ReSPIRA in Project 2 to determine the generalizability of PGI2 as a therapeutic target.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the leading cause of bronchiolitis in infants worldwide with healthcare costs estimated at $365-$585 million per year. Human epidemiological studies have identified age at initial infection as an independent risk factor for the development of childhood asthma. We have previously demonstrated in a mouse model that age of initial infection with RSV influences respiratory function in later life - infection of neonatal mice, d 7d of age, primes for a Th2 immune response that contributes to the development of long-term airways dysfunction. The mechanism(s) underlying the influence of age on the immune and pulmonary responses elicited in response to RSV infection remains obscure. Our preliminary data reveal that expression of IL-4Ra is developmentally regulated such that its expression declines on lung mDCs and Th1 cells as animals age (i.e. expression is highest in the neonate). Furthermore, downregulation of IL-4Ra expression during RSV infection in the neonate 1) inhibits the initial Th2 biased immune response and 2) protects against persistent Th2 immune deviation and pulmonary pathophysiology observed with secondary RSV infection in the adult. Our data support the expression of IL-4Ra in early life as a critical and novel age-dependent mechanism of severe RSV infection. Therefore, our hypothesis is that developmentally regulated expression of IL-4Ra on neonatal myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) is responsible for biasing immune and pulmonary responses towards asthmatic type responses in later life. Specifically, our preliminary data suggest a unique mechanism whereby elevated levels of IL-4Ra on neonatal mDCs initiates a Th2-polarized immune response to RSV and signaling through IL-4Ra on neonatal Th1 cells results in their ablation. We will explore the validity of this hypothesis in the following specific aims: Aim 1 will determine if age-related expression of IL-4Ra on mDCs is responsible for altered mDC function in neonatal RSV infection resulting in an asthma-promoting DC. We will leverage conditional cell ablation and adoptive transfer strategies to determine the functional role of IL-4Ra on neonatal mDCs. Aim 2 will explore our prediction that elevated levels of IL-4Ra on neonatal Th1 cells are responsible for their specific ablation during neonatal RSV infection and for the persistence of the asthma phenotype following neonatal RSV infection. Aim 3 will demonstrate that exacerbation of allergic asthma in adult mice is due to an altered Th2- inducing mDC formed during neonatal RSV infection. The concepts presented here are novel; and the data derived from these studies are expected to have a positive paradigm-shifting impact in understanding RSV- mediated asthma.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RSV causes significant morbidity and mortality in infants with a global disease burden of 64 million cases and 160,000 deaths annually. Our hypothesis is that a novel age-related mechanism mediated by elevated levels of IL-4Ra in early life, exists and programs for severe RSV, asthma, and susceptibility to asthma following neonatal RSV infection. If our hypothesis is correct, the concepts established here will not only have important implications for understanding mechanisms of RSV-mediated airway disease but also for understanding neonatal immunity and mechanisms of immunomodulation relevant to the development of safer and more effective pediatric vaccines.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT 2: Our long-term goal is to elucidate mechanisms by which respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)contributes to asthma pathogenesis. RSV is the leading cause of infant bronchiolitis and a major cause ofasthma attacks. RSV is likely involved in asthma development. Severe RSV bronchiolitis in infancy isassociated with childhood asthma. Our data suggest that different RSV strains cause differential acutedisease severity, both in infants and in experimentally infected mice. Our central hypothesis is that morevirulent RSV strains will be tightly associated with early childhood wheezing and asthma development andcause greater epithelial damage, TH2-type inflammation, and airway mucus expression. Our projectrepresents a synergy between RSV molecular epidemiology and mechanistic mouse models of RSVpathogenesis. It is part of a larger study focusing on mechanisms of bronchiolitis-to-asthma in children. TheReSPIRA (Respiratory Study Protection Infection RSV Asthma) cohort will follow 2000 infants until 3-4 yearsof age. We expect 20-30% of infants will have RSV lower respiratory tract infection (severe), 35-40% willhave mild RSV infection, and 35-40% will have no RSV infection detectable. Clinical characteristics of illnesswill be defined, including a quantitative bronchiolitis severity score (BSS) and prolonged wheezing. We willgenotype the approximately 1000 anticipated RSV isolates from the ReSPIRA cohort. We will constructdendrograms to define genetic relatedness of the RSV strains. In collaboration with Dr. Tina Hartert's group(Vanderbilt), we will analyze RSV genotypes and clinical parameters such as BSS and prolonged wheezingto define the role of RSV strain differences in disease seventy and asthma development. We will measurecytokine/chemokine levels in patient respiratory secretions to define how RSV genotypes impact the hostresponse. We will investigate mechanisms of ReSPIRA RSV strain pathogenesis in a mouse model. Wehypothesize that different ReSPIRA RSVs will cause differential lung IL 13 and mucus expression andepithelial damage in mice. We will investigate the role of neutrophils in ReSPIRA RSV infection by neutrophildepletion. We will define the role of RSV fusion protein variability in differential pathogenesis using a RSVreverse genetics strategy.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT 3: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of respiratory failure in young childrenand severe RSV bronchiolitis has been identified as risk factor for the subsequent development of asthma inchildren. Currently, there is no effective vaccine for RSV and pharmacologic treatment is far from optimal.Development of new therapeutic agents is critical to reduce the morbidity and mortality from this importantpathogen, and to perhaps modify the risk of childhood asthma. Our preliminary data suggest thatprostaglandin (PG) 12 is a novel therapeutic target for RSV. In a well characterized murine model of RSVinfection, we reported that transgenic mice that constitutively overexpress PGI synthase (PGIS) weresignificantly protected from RSV-induced illness. In addition, we found that mice which cannot signalthrough the PGI2 receptor (IP) had significantly exacerbated weight loss and delayed recovery after RSVinfection. Further, in a collaborative study of infants admitted with RSV bronchiolitis, we found that afunctional polymorphism in the promoter region of the PGI synthase (PGIS) gene was associated with anincrease in the urinary PGI2 metabolite and less severe bronchiolitis. These data strongly suggest that PGI2and IP signaling protect against RSV-induced disease. The long term objective of this application are todefine role of PGI2 in RSV-induced airway pathophysiology and the mechanism by which PGI2 protectsagainst RSV-induced illness. We have isolated an RSV strain (01/2-20) from an infant with bronchiolitis thatinduced airway responsiveness, airway mucus expression, and high levels of lung IL-13 protein in mice. Inaim 1, we hypothesize that PGI2 and IP signaling protects against RSV 01/2-20 -induced airwayresponsiveness, inflammation, and pathology. We also have preliminary data which reveals that PGI2selectively downregulates bone marrow derived dendritic cell and macrophage expression of TLR4, a patternrecognition receptor that is activated by the RSV F protein. In aim 2 we hypothesize that PGI2 modulatesRSV-induced immunopathology in a TLR4-dependent manner. The proposed studies may result in a novel,effective therapy for RSV bronchiolitis.',\n",
       " 'Elucidation of the events responsible for HIV-1 and SIV mucosal transmission in the vagina, cervix andrectum, including a precise definition of virus - host cell - innate/adaptive immune interactions that precedethe establishment of viremia and viral latency, could be instrumental in the design and development ofeffective vaccines. In recent years, our laboratories have taken significant strides toward addressing theseobjectives by developing a theoretical and experimental framework with which to identify transmitted/founderHIV-1 and SIV genomes responsible for virus transmission, and in parallel, developing in situ hybridizationand quantitative PCR methods for detecting HIV-1 and SIV sequences in relevant mucosal andlymphoreticular tissues. However, these complementary molecular assays have not previously been usedtogether in a systematic manner to analyze SIV transmission. Virology Core D will, for the first time, combinethese technologically advanced approaches to study mucosal infections by SIVmac251, SIVmac239 andSHIV{SF162P3} with and without vaccine intervention in support of Projects 1-5. The overall objective of theVirology Core is thus to provide state-of-the-art molecular tools, experience and service toconsortium investigators that will enable a spatial, temporal, genetic and immunocytohistologicalunderstanding of mucosal SIV transmission and subsequent virus dissemination in naive animalsand to define sites and mechanisms of interception of this process in animals that are actively orpassively vaccinated using different vaccine modalities.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of severe lower respiratory tract illness in infants and the elderly. There is no approved vaccine despite decades of effort. Early attempts to develop a formalin- inactivated vaccine (FI-RSV) resulted in disease enhancement following environmental exposure to RSV. Efforts to develop recombinant subunit vaccines have met with limited success due to poor immunogenicity and short-lived responses. Over the last few years, several avenues of study have suggested that the adverse inflammatory responses associated with RSV infection, and perhaps the failure of the FI-RSV vaccine, are linked to the RSV-G protein which plays a critical role in virus attachment to target cells. RSV-G contains a CX3C chemokine motif that interacts with the CX3CR1 chemokine receptor and appears to elicit an inflammatory Th2-biased immune response that contributes to disease pathogenesis. We have shown that antibody responses to the CX3C motif can reduce virus infectivity, inhibit RSV-G chemokine-modulating activity and reduce lung inflammation following infection. Vaccine designs that elicit an IFN response may also help to reduce the Th2-biased response and lung inflammation associated with RSV infection. In this Phase I project, we will use an innovative approach to produce synthetic nanoparticle vaccines carrying the RSV-G peptide coupled with RSV T-cell target antigens that favor IFN responses. Nanoparticles will be fabricated using layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of oppositely charged polypeptides, including designed peptides (DP) carrying the antigen payload, to build ultrathin films on solid nano-sized cores. We have shown that vaccines made by this strategy improve the immunogenicity of both T-cell and antibody target epitopes without triggering adverse inflammatory reactions. The current proposal will (1) identify the optimal DP designs for increasing loading and stability of nanoparticles, (2) select LbL nanoparticle vaccine designs based on potency and phenotype of antibody and T-cell responses induced (with particular emphasis on IFN responses that have been shown to improve protection from RSV disease), and (3) test the biological activity of antibody responses in assays measuring virus and chemokine neutralization, inhibition of chemotaxis, and protection of mice from viral burden and lung inflammation following challenge with RSV. The RSV-G DP will include a CD4 T-cell epitope that overlaps the chemokine motif, and will be complemented by addition of T-cell target epitopes from RSV-M2 or RSV-F to provide additional IFN modulation of the Th1/Th2 balance. Thus, the novel nanoparticle vaccines produced in this study will have the capacity to elicit multiple mechanisms of protection against RSV infection and aberrant lung inflammation. The deliverable of this project is one or more LbL RSV-G vaccine candidates with demonstrated safety and efficacy in animal models; these candidates will be further developed in a subsequent Phase II project that will complete the steps necessary for Investigational New Drug application filing and eventual clinical testing. The application of this innovative approach to RSV vaccine development will also impact vaccine development for other infectious diseases.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will use an innovative nanoparticle technology to produce novel vaccine candidates for respiratory syncytial virus. Since the vaccines contain a portion of the virus responsible for both infection and host inflammation, vaccine-induced immune responses will not only reduce the rate of RSV infectivity but will also alleviate the lung inflammation associated with RSV disease. A vaccine emerging from this effort will address a large unmet need in infants, children, elderly and immunocompromised patients.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many important biological determinants of HIV-1 disease progression and transmission map to the envelope glycoprotein, including antibody neutralization susceptibility, viral tropism for entry and epitopes for T cell response. Genetic and phenotypic characterizations of the envelope gene suggest a bottleneck effect in the spread of the virus to other body compartments and transmission, resulting in a predominantly homogenous viral population. However, the limitations in current methods to accurately assign HIV-1 coreceptor usage, distinguish genetic variations and detect minor variants in the HIV quasispecies within a patient and between transmission pairs have led to controversial findings. Furthermore, the small patient sample size studied has been too small to make broad generalization regarding mechanisms of HIV transmission and pathogensis. Lastly, these various properties of the envelope gene have been studied predominantly in subtype B infection and less clearly elucidated in HIV-1 subtype C, the most rapidly spreading and prevalent infection worldwide. We hypothesize that a heterogenous HIV-1 population with different envelope sequences and coreceptor usage are transmitted during infection but is not fully characterized and measured by our current available techniques. We propose to use novel and more sensitive methods to determine coreceptor usage and to perform in-depth sequencing and genetic analyses of the envelope gene from a large subtype C clinical cohort from Botswana. The envelope gene in subtype C infection will be studied in longitudinal samples, as well as between plasma-breast milk and mother-infant pairs. We plan to study in greater depth the properties of the HIV-1 subtype C envelope glycoprotein with the following specific aims: 1) identify clinical and genetic determinants of coreceptor switching, 2) assess for correlates of breastfeeding transmission of HIV-1 and 3) examine pattern of viral transmission among mother-to-child transmitting pairs occurring through different routes of MTCT using ultradeep sequencing. The results of this study will further the understanding of viral evolution in the context of transmission and disease progression, identify clinical correlates of transmission and disease progression, and ultimately give insights into potential strategies of prevention, treatment and vaccine development in those parts of the world most affected by HIV.

Therefore, blocking HIV-1 infection in the penile mucosa is integral to curbing the global AIDS epidemic. Effective intervention strategies to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV-1 most likely will need to interrupt viral infection during the earliest stages of mucosal transmission. One of the barriers to developing an effective AIDS vaccine/microbicide is a lack of understanding of the early pathogenesis in the establishment of mucosal HIV-1 infection. Although the majority of the 15 million HIV-infected men worldwide acquired infection via the penile mucosa, very little is known about the precise routes of viral entry into the male genital compartment. Furthermore, the biologic basis underlying the protective effect of male circumcision in preventing HIV-1 acquisition in heterosexual men remains unclear. Understanding the initial events of viral entry and dissemination during acute HIV-1 infection in the penile mucosa is critical for the design of intervention strategies to block HIV-1 mucosal transmission in the male genital tract.    Our overall goal is to elucidate the immunopathogenesis of penile mucosal transmission, an important but neglected area of HIV/AIDS research. Understanding the early events associated with HIV-1 acquisition in the male genital tract has been hampered by the lack of a physiologically-relevant animal penile transmission model. To date, no reliable, well-characterized simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/rhesus monkey prepuce infection model has been published. The reason for the absence of this transmission model is that it has been technically very difficult to initiate penile infection in nonhuman primates (NHP). To overcome this hurdle, we exploited our recent understanding that TRIM5 alleles play a role in modulating mucosal acquisition of SIV in Indian-origin rhesus monkeys. We have developed a technique for atraumatically exposing the penile mucosa to SIV and demonstrated that systemic SIV infection can be achieved after prepuce exposures in rhesus monkeys that are relatively more permissive to mucosal infection on the basis of their TRIM5 genotypes. In this R21 application, our objective is to utilize this novel SIV/rhesus monkey penile infection model to study HIV-1 pathogenesis in the male genital tract. To accomplish this, we will first refine this SIV penile transmission model and determine whether it recapitulates key virologic and immunologic features of mucosal HIV-1 infection. We will then use this system to explore the early events of HIV/SIV pathogenesis in the penile mucosa. The data from these studies will demonstrate the validity of the SIV/rhesus monkey penile transmission model, illuminate the mechanisms of HIV-1 transmission in the penile mucosa, and form a foundation to dissect the mucosal immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 infection during acute infection in the male genital compartment. These insights will provide the biologic basis for developing rational interventions that prevent HIV-1 sexual transmission in men.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the majority of the HIV-infected men worldwide acquired infection via the penile mucosa, very little is known about the precise routes of viral entry into the male reproductive tract. We will use a novel SIV/rhesus monkey model of penile infection to elucidate the mechanisms of HIV-1 mucosal transmission in the male genital tract. This animal mucosal transmission model has the potential to have a transformative impact on developing intervention strategies to block HIV-1 acquisition in the human male genital mucosa.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Incomplete understanding as to how HIV influences TB transmission dynamics in Africa represents a major gap in knowledge and a significant obstacle to disrupting TB transmission. Characterizing recent TB transmission networks, identifying sites of ongoing TB transmission, and understanding how HIV influences TB transmission are all critical steps in developing novel, strategic intensified TB case-finding approaches in Africa. Our central hypotheses are that the majority of recent TB transmission in this high HIV prevalence setting takes place in community gathering and health care sites, as opposed to households, and HIV-infected persons are at significantly increased risk of recent TB transmission compared to HIV-uninfected persons. The objectives of the current proposal are the following: Aim 1: Identify and characterize recent TB transmission networks in an East African rural setting. We will perform molecular epidemiologic analysis of all diagnosed, culture-positive TB cases initiating TB therapy in Tororo Municipality over 3 years (~360) in order to identify recent TB transmission networks defined by genotypic clustering of TB isolates. Aim 2: Locate sites of frequent TB transmission through analysis of the geographic distribution and social networks of genotype-clustered incident TB cases. We will combine molecular epidemiologic, geospatial and social network data to identify TB transmission  hot spots , characterized by high levels of TB transmission. These  hot spots  may occur in commercial, social (e.g. markets, bars, churches), or health care settings. We will investigate how HIV influences where TB is transmitted at a community level Aim 3: Pilot test a place-based intensified TB case-finding strategy at two identified locations of high TB transmission risk. Through a focused program of mentored training and coursework, the candidate will develop advanced skills in molecular epidemiology, Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis and the spatial analysis of epidemiologic data, social network analysis, and the conduct of prospective clinical studies in resource-limited settings. These scientific and career aims will serve as the basis for the long term research goal of conducting large, community-wide trials of targeted intensified TB case-finding in sub-Saharan Africa in order to reduce TB mortality and transmission among HIV-infected and uninfected persons.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): This project will advance our understanding of how TB is spreading through a rural community with a generalized HIV epidemic in East Africa and serve as the foundation for developing novel ways to disrupt TB transmission and reduce TB mortality through early diagnosis and intensified case-finding, a goal of significant scientific and public health importance. Identification of the location of community  hot-spots  of TB transmission by HIV status gives us the opportunity to pilot test interventions to identify new TB cases and stop subsequent transmission of TB. Data from this study will be highly useful to the design and implementation of community-based intensified TB case-finding approaches in sub-Saharan Africa for future R01 studies.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this career development award is for Dr. Philip A. Chan to acquire the training and experience necessary to become an independent clinical investigator. The career goals of this proposal are to gain expertise in the field of HIV-oriented molecular epidemiology including familiarity with biostatistics and study design, to become skilled using molecular phylogenetics to study HIV transmission patterns and population dynamics, to acquire experience in HIV behavior and prevention sciences, and to receive proper training in the Responsible Conduct of Research including ethical practices. The number of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected individuals continues to increase in the United States, propagated by transmission in social networks among high-risk groups. Identification of networks within which HIV transmission occurs can lead to targeted screening and effective prevention interventions. Current HIV epidemiologic contact tracing programs implemented by public health departments are often limited by reporting and recall bias secondary to the lag time between infection and diagnosis as well as the reluctance of HIV-infected individuals to report partners. This research proposal integrates molecular epidemiology and public health programs to identify transmission networks and develop behavior assessment and intervention tools. In collaboration with other major academic centers in Rhode Island and the Department of Health, molecular epidemiology will be used to enhance contact tracing programs and develop future targeted prevention strategies. The objectives of the research are to: 1) Identify transmission networks among HIV- infected individuals using molecular phylogenetic approaches; 2) Determine risk factors and characteristics associated with transmission networks that may be targeted for interventions; and 3) Identify contacts of individuals forming transmission networks to diagnose HIV-infected yet unaware cases, characterize risk behaviors, and assess acceptability of novel prevention interventions. This research will allow a comprehensive investigation of HIV epidemiology and development of an effective public health model that can be implemented elsewhere. During the course of this award, Dr. Chan will be mentored by experts from Brown University in the field of molecular genetics and HIV epidemiology including Dr. Rami Kantor (primary mentor) and Dr. Kenneth Mayer.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by the applicant): The HIV epidemic continues to affect high-risk individuals in the United States including men who have sex with men (MSM), African Americans, and other disadvantaged groups. The goal of this project is to use molecular epidemiology to investigate the transmission of HIV among these groups. By identifying risk factors associated with HIV transmission, appropriate interventions can be implemented in the future to halt the spread of infection.',\n",
       " 'Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection causes diarrhea, bloody diarrhea and in severe cases, patients develop Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and central nervous system (CNS) impairment. STEC induced neuronal disabilities includes a broad spectrum of symptoms as cortical blindness, poor fine-motor coordination, seizures and changes in consciousness including coma. Importantly, CNS manifestations often associate with mortality or severe sequelae. STEC produce Shiga toxins 1 and 2 (Stx1 and Stx2); among them, Stx2 is more potent as a cause of severe HUS and CNS impairment. However, precise mechanisms of Shiga toxin induced CNS impairment are not yet clear. I propose to reveal the mechanisms of Shiga toxin action in the CNS by using in vitro neuron-astrocytic cell culture and in vivo with the Stx2 induced hindlimb paralysis murine model.',\n",
       " 'Abstract Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is recognized as the single most important cause of acute respiratory disease in infants and young children worldwide. Elderly populations and immunocompromised individuals are also at significant risk for serious RSV disease. Despite the very substantial disease burden imposed by this virus worldwide, there are no vaccines available. Three interrelated problems have impeded RSV vaccine development. First and foremost is safety. An early formalin-inactivated vaccine (FI-RSV) predisposed infants to more severe disease upon natural exposure to live virus resulting in concerns about the safety of all subsequently developed RSV vaccines, particularly nonreplicating vaccines. Attenuated virus vaccines, which may be effective immunogens, can pose risks in many target populations such as infants and immunocompromised individuals. A second problem is the failure of many vaccine candidates to stimulate protective, long-term immune responses even in model systems, illustrating the lack of knowledge of immune mechanisms required for long-term, protective anti-RSV immune responses. A third significant problem is the failure of most vaccine candidates that have proved to be safe and protective in animal models to stimulate effective immune responses in humans indicating that there are undefined differences in stimulation of humoral anti-RSV responses in model systems and in humans. This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that novel virus-like particle (VLP) RSV vaccine candidates, unlike any previously tested, may be developed into an effective RSV vaccine. Preliminary results have indicated that these candidates are very effective and safe vaccines in a murine system. The responses of human B cells to these novel vaccine candidates will be explored in a unique system recently developed to study human B cell immune responses, human-mouse xenochimeras. This system will be used to determine requirements for potent stimulation of human B cells by VLPs and RSV. To test the hypothesis, three aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1: to define structural elements in VLPs important for effective humoral immune responses to RSV. Specific Aim 2: to determine the requirements for formation of long-lived plasma cells and memory responses to VLPs and RSV in murine systems. Specific Aim 3: to use human PBL-engrafted humanized NOD scid IL2R&#947;null mice to examine human antibody responses to RSV-VLPs and RSV.',\n",
       " 'Abstract: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children and is also a predictable cause of respiratory illness in persons of all ages. During RSV infection, a key target of host immune response is the fusion (F) protein. Although the neutralizing epitopes of F have been identified within the three-dimensional model of the RSV F homotrimer, our understanding of the structure-immunogenicity relationship between RSV F epitopes and the humoral immune response remains incomplete. Significant questions remain such as: 1) immunodominance, if any, of the RSV F epitopes; 2) the effect of pre/post fusion conformational state transition on the stability and solvent exposure of antigenic sites; 3) the relative importance of tertiary domain structures and F oligomerization for neutralizing antibody generation, potency, and recognition; and 4) the avidity and affinity of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies to RSV F epitopes. To address these fundamental questions, we have formed an interdisciplinary academic partnership and have established three Specific Aims, each designed to address a key component of the proposed project. We will first rationally design, synthesize, and purify RSV F subdomains bearing &#8805;1 neutralizing epitopes. We will then use such proteins in two lines of complementary experiments: 1) characterization of the quality and quantity of antigenic site-specific neutralizing antibody response to specific RSV F epitopes during primary and secondary RSV infection in rodents and humans; and 2) immunogenicy and protective efficacy of structurally distinct RSV F subdomains, especially when presented in the context of human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 capsid scaffolds such as pentamers (capsomeres) and virus-like particles (VLPs); recent evidence suggests that each of these vaccine platforms can function as a self-adjuvanting antigen delivery system that elicits broad cellular and humoral immune responses against heterologous antigens. Our approach utilizes the collection of unique reagents and expertise as well as scientific innovations in molecular biology, virology, immunology, vaccine development, and structural biology among the research institutions and personnel. The proposed experiments are expected to further our understanding of host humoral immune response during RSV infection, with implications for RSV diagnostics, clinical study design, and vaccine development.',\n",

A vaccine capable of preventing sexual transmission across genital or rectal mucosal surfaces could provide a method for stopping the AIDS epidemic. The ultimate success of strategies to prevent sexual transmission of HIV depends, in part, on a better understanding of the virological and immunological mechanisms that underlie sexual transmission. Numerous studies have demonstrated the difficulty to achieve sterile protection from vaginally or rectally acquired HIV/SIV using parenteral immunization. Mucosal immunization is seen as the best approach to achieve sustainable immune responses at mucosal sites of viral entry. Defining the mechanisms of vaginal HIV transmission, in particular the initial immune response is central to the development of effective strategies to develop a successful mucosal AIDS vaccine. Our knowledge of the initial target cells involved in mucosal transmission is still evolving. Increasing evidence suggests that the initial site of productive infection occurs in situ at the mucosal surface. Studies of vaginal transmission suggest that the potential initial target cell may be either activated CD4+ T cells or intraepithelial dendritic cells. Precise dissection of viral targets and pathways involved in sexual HIV transmission will prove essential to the global effort to develop a protective vaccine. The identification of initial target cells and the ability to elicit and to enhance cellular or humoral immune responses at mucosal sites is likely to be a crucial step in the development of novel vaccines. These questions are extremely difficult to pursue experimentally in humans. In this study we propose to examine in situ viral infection at mucosal portal of entry in the SIV/cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) macaque model using SIV tagged with GFP.  Specific aims will include: 1) To identify the types of cells initially infected (i.e., lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells), their phenotype and function; 2) To investigate the mechanisms, time course, and pathways of viral spread from site of initial infection; and, 3) To explore generation of early mucosal cellular immune response at vaginal site of SIV infection.\",\n",

Women of childbearing age are at the greatest risk for HIV-1 infection, resulting in a corresponding increase in HIV-1 infection in women, newborns, and infants worldwide.  However, despite the predominance of sexual transmission in the continued spread of HIV-1, the mechanisms of sexual transmission of HIV-1 to women are still poorly understood.  For example, it is not known whether cell-free virus, cell-associated virus or both are essential for HIV-1 transmission in humans.  Potential mechanisms of HIV-1 transmission across mucosal epithelium include 1) direct infection of epithelial cells; 2) transcytosis through epithelial cells and/or specialized microfold (M) cells; 3) epithelial transmigration of infected donor cells; 4) uptake of intraepithelial Langerhans cells and 5) circumvention of the epithelial barrier through physical breaches.  Successful transfer of virus across epithelial barriers may result in HIV-1 uptake by migratory dendritic cells (by DC-SIGN or another mannose C-type lectin receptor) and subsequent dissemination to draining lymph nodes and/or localized mucosal HIV-1-infection, leading to recruitment of additional susceptible cells. Although many questions remain unanswered, these investigations have revealed potential targets for prevention of HIV transmission in women which are critical for limiting the global AIDS pandemic.\",\n",

Similar to HIV infection in humans, SIV infection in non-African primate species results in chronic disease that culminates in AIDS. The well-defined SlV infection of rhesus macaques is an excellent animal model system to assess HIV transmission and pathogenesis for several reasons. SIV infection In macaques closely resembles many aspects of HIV infection in humans including events associated with transmission, cellular tropism of the virus, viral replication patterns. disease progression, and the nature of the host immune response. Furthermore, the SIV/macaque model is important because knowledge of the time, route, and number of viral exposures Is known, the viral stock used to infect the macaques is well-characterized, and there is the ability to frequently sample important tissues (blood, lymph nodes, mucosal sites, etc) throughout infection. For HIV and SIV, the major mode of transmission for new infections is mucosal transmission, i.e. the virus has to pass through a mucosal membrane to infect the new host However, the probability to become infected from a mucosa] encounter is actually quite low. A variety of factors contribute to this low probability, including inhibitory proteins at mucosal surfaces, the difficulty to pass an intact mucosal membrane and the probability for the virus to find a suitable target cell to Infect Initially as soon as it passes the membrane. Using the macaque model, our laboratory has focused its work on oral transmission of HlV/SIV, a route that is important for mother-to-child (vertical) transmission through breast feeding and for transmission during oral sex when virus is present in semen. However, it still remains unclear what the most important events are which permit the actual transmission itself. Here we expand upon our previous findings by assessing the impact of immune activation on the transmission of SIV administered into the oral cavity of macaques. We hypothesize that higher levels of immune activation will increase the potential for SIV to elicit a productive infection. These studies will utilize a low dose regimen of viral Inoculations to mimic the viral levels that are present in breast milk and semen. We will assess transmission of SIV while the mucosa is experiencing a state of immune activation, gingivitis. Gingivitis is a common inflammation of the oral mucosa in humans and therefore may be impacting oral transmission in humans exposed to HIV containing semen (through receptive oral intercourse). These studies assessing the impact of the immune response on oral transmission are likely be applicable to other sites of mucosal transmission, and will be important for determining the immune mechanisms that impact the success of SIV/HIV mucosal transmission. Our long term goal is to utilize these findings to aid in the design of SIV/HlV vaccines that are able to elicit sterilizing immunity by preventing the infection of the first target cell when mucosal sites are exposed to HIV/SIV.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an opportunistic pathogen and an important cause of healthcare-associated infections. MRSA is transmitted through direct or indirect contact in the healthcare setting. In acute care settings, we use Contact Precautions (health care workers [HCW] wear gowns and gloves for all patient contact) for patients colonized with MRSA to prevent transmission to other patients. Current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Isolation Guidelines suggest modifying Contact Precautions in long term care facilities (LTCF), but there is little evidence to guide how to modify them. The goal of this project is to develop an intervention to minimize MRSA transmission in community-based LTCF. We will determine the optimal modifications of Contact Precautions for LTCF in order to reduce the risk of MRSA transmission and allow care in a home-like, patient-centered environment. LTCFs provide multiple levels of care including rehabilitation care, skilled nursing care and maintenance care. In the PI's current VA Merit award, we demonstrated that MRSA transmission is four fold higher in rehabilitation care than maintenance care. This suggests that the types of care delivered modify the risk of transmission. Recently we developed a novel surrogate measure of MRSA transmission, detection of MRSA on HCW gown and gloves during HCW-patient interaction. Using this new methodology, we will test the hypothesis that MRSA transmission will vary significantly by type of contact (e.g. catheter or drain care) in community-based long term care facilities. Our first aim is to estimate the frequency of and risk factors for MRSA transmission to protective gowns worn by HCW interacting with MRSA colonized LTC residents using an observational study. Our second aim is to estimate the cumulative risk of MRSA transmission to protective gowns worn by HCW interacting with MRSA colonized LTC residents in rehabilitation care, skilled nursing care and maintenance care to assess different modifications to Contact Precautions in long term care facilities using mathematical models. Our third aim is to estimate the costs of these different modifications to Contact Precautions using activity-based costing. The results of our proposed study will improve the quality of care in community-based LTCF by providing evidence for when protective gowns are needed.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an important cause of healthcare-associated infections. These are infections that patients acquire during the course of receiving treatment for other conditions within the health care system. Preventing MRSA transmission and infections is an important quality of care goal for healthcare systems. MRSA colonization is more common in long term care facilities than in acute care hospitals; however, the optimal infection control precautions to prevent MRSA transmission in long term care facilities are unknown.

Inhibition of these critical transporters can have therapeutic benefits or cause serious side effects in the CNS. Development of an assay platform and a comprehensive profile of drugs' inhibitory effects on important CNS transporters can have enormous impact on drug discovery and development, such as elucidating drugs' potential side effects in the CNS, and advancing development of new drugs to treat various CNS diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's diseases, epilepsy etc., The overall goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive assay platform for evaluating drugs' inhibitory effects on key CNS transporters, and then to establish the industry's largest database on inhibitory effects of over 1000 prescription CNS and peripherally acting drugs on these transporters. The initial Phase I work will start with developing assays for 10 crucial CNS transporters, which are known as therapeutic targets or to play critical roles on CNS physiology. A small library of marketed CNS drugs will then be profiled for their inhibitory effects on these transporters, with aims to reveal possible interactions of the drugs with these transporters that are previously unknown to the research community. Future study would extend the scope to developing assays for more than 30 major CNS transporters, and scale up inhibitory profiling efforts for more than 1000 marketed drugs, with aims to explain causes of certain CNS side effects, to reveal potential new therapeutic indications of existing drugs, and to discover potential therapeutic benefits of inhibiting certain key CNS transporters in treating various CNS diseases.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Osteoporosis is a widely prevalent contributor to frailty, increased morbidity, and mortality in the elderly and results from an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. Sirtuins have been implicated in metabolism, longevity, and healthspan. Resveratrol (RSV) is a sirtuin activating compound that enhances bone mineral density (BMD) in mice, and sirtuin knockout mice exhibit increased osteoclastogenesis. SRT2183 and SRT1720 are synthetic resveratrol mimetics (SyRMs) that were designed to specifically activate sirtuin1 (Sirt1), but an increasing number of reports suggest that RSV and SyRMs act on targets other than Sirt1. Our preliminary data demonstrate that: 1) SyRMs inhibit c-Src phosphorylation, actin ring formation, osteoclast formation, and bone resorption, but RSV does not; 2) SyRMs also disrupt actin rings and inhibit bone resorption in mature osteoclasts, but RSV does not; 3) knockout of Sirt1 expression impairs bone quality in vivo and enhances osteoclastogenesis ex vivo, but SyRMs still inhibit actin ring and osteoclast formation in Sirt1 knockout cells; 4) RSV treatment of young mice increases osteoblastogenesis and decreases osteoclastogenesis; and 5) RSV treatment of very old mice markedly improves bone mass and bone quality. Hypothesis and Specific Aims:  We hypothesize that SyRMs inhibit critical pathways of osteoclast formation and function involving c-Src phosphorylation, Rho GTPase activation, and NFATc1 expression. Intriguingly, despite lack of effect in vitro, RSV exerts pronounced benefit in vivo, suggesting that the predominant effects are on osteoblasts. We propose that in vivo treatment with RSV and SyRMs will both restore the youthful balance between osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation and enhancing bone mineral density and bone quality, but possibly via different mechanisms. We also hypothesize that the SyRMs can exert beneficial effects upon bone independent of Sirt1. 1. Determine the mechanisms whereby RSV, RSV mimetics, and Sirt1 regulate osteoclast and osteoblast formation. The results of this aim will answer the critical questions of whether or not SyRMs inhibit osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting c-Src phosphorylation, Rho GTPase activation, and NFATc1 expression and whether the effects of SyRMs depend upon Sirt1. 2. Determine the skeletal impacts of RSV, RSV mimetics, and Sirt1 in vivo.  The results of this aim will answer the critical questions of whether or not in vivo RSV and  SyRMs prevent age-related and/or ovariectomy-induced bone loss, whether RSV and SyRMs  exert either anabolic and anti-resorptive effects on bone or both, and whether the impacts of RSV  and SyRMs depend upon Sirt1 gene expression.  There is a pressing need for targeted agents to improve the quality of bone and to reduce the adverse consequences of osteoporosis. Our proposed studies will permit us to understand better the mechanism(s) underlying the impacts of RSV and SyRMs and their relationship to Sirt1 expression. Our work will also have significant clinical impact given the widespread and deleterious burden of osteoporosis in the elderly and can be applied to the utilization of RSV and RSV mimetics in the clinic.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Osteoporosis results from an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation leading to progressive bone loss, fractures, and increased morbidity and mortality in the elderly. We have found that synthetic resveratrol mimetics (SyRMs) inhibit Rho GTPase activation, NFATc1 expression, actin ring formation, and osteoclast formation and resorption. We hypothesize that SyRMs are both anabolic and anti-resorptive and can therefore restore the youthful balance between bone resorption and formation. We will test this hypothesis by studying the cellular impacts of resveratrol and SyRMs on bone during aging and in a mouse model of menopausal bone loss. By utilizing mice with knockout of the sirtuin gene in either osteoblasts or osteoclasts, we will also assess whether these impacts depend upon sirtuin expression. The data derived from our proposed experiments can be applied to the development of new treatments for osteoporosis.',\n",

       " 'In collaboration with Dr. Fernando Polack (Vanderbilt University) and the Infant Foundation in Buenos Aires, Argentina we recruited a prospective cohort of children aged 0-9 months of age from 5 hospitals in Buenos Aires. The primary clinical outcome is severity of disease (O2 saturation < 93%) and the secondary outcomes are RSV titer and Th2 polarization (blood lymphocytes are isolated and challenged with pro-inflammatory agonists including LPS). From 2003-2006, we recruited approximately 800 children to the study: 400 infected with RSV (240 with severe disease, 160 with mild disease) and 400 controls (uninfected). Our initial genetic analyses have focused on the role of functional SNPs in TLR4 (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile), and NRF2 (-653A/G, -651G/A and -617C/A). These genes have been identified as candidate susceptibility genes for RSV infection in mice, and TLR4 has also been associated with RSV infection in children. In our initial analyses, we found that the -651G/A SNP was only found in severe RSV cases and conferred greater risk of disease relative to the wild type (OR: 1.9; CI: 1.4, 2.7). We also found that children heterozygous for the Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile mutations in TLR4 were at higher risk of severe RSV disease relative to children with wild-type TLR4 genotype (OR: 1.7; CI: 1.2, 2.6). However, when socioeconomic status (SES) was considered, we found children from low SES families and heterozygous for TLR4 Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile mutations had significantly less severe disease compared to wild type (4% severe disease vs 11% severe disease, p<0.05) compared with children from middle/high SES (9% severe disease vs 2% mild disease, p<0.05). These results are consistent with a role for TLR4 in RSV disease severity, but interaction of TLR4 genotype with environment must be considered when evaluating risk of these mutations. Many patients experience mild symptoms, but some individuals are highly susceptible to RSV infection and exhibit more severe symptoms which may result in hospitalization and sometimes death. The mechanism for differential responses to RSV infection is unknown. To develop a cell model to identify genetic determinants of differential susceptibility to RSV infection in humans.  Lymphoblasts from the Coriell Institutes human variation panels were used. These panels consist of various human lymphoblast cell lines established from multiple donors from a number of different ethnic and racial groups which can be genotyped and profiled for gene expression patterns to provide information on genetic differences that determine differential responses to RSV. Cells were infected with RSV (strain A2) and analyzed at various time-points for levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines using real-time RT-PCR. Infectivity was evaluated by measuring expression of viral genes and proteins using real-time PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. The viral load differed significantly between panels as well as between individuals within panels. Similarly, expression levels of IL-6, TNF-, IFN-, IFN-, and TLR4 differed between panels and individuals within panels in response to infection. Differences were also observed in the kinetics of the cytokine response and viral load. We have developed a novel cell model of RSV disease. Significant inter-individual variation in infectivity and inflammatory response to RSV infection suggests that genetic background is an important determinant of susceptibility to RSV disease. We also developed a mouse model of RSV disease by infecting inbred mice (JAX) with 1x106 plaque forming units (pfu) of RSV-19 or vehicle control (Hep 2 cells in 50L of HBSS). Significant inter-strain variation in protein, cellular, mucus cell metaplasia (MCM), and RSV-N mRNA expression phenotypes following infection were found among the 30 inbred strains. The most severe RSV disease pathology was found in A/J and Balb/cJ mice, while C3H/HeJ mice were among the most resistant. Phenotype heritability was high, ranging from 48% (BAL protein, 1 d PI) to 97% (MCM, 5 d PI). Cosegregation analysis of the multiple RSV response phenotypes across the 30 strains illustrated the relatedness of some phenotypes, and also the bi-phasic nature of RSV disease in mice (some disease phenotypes peak at 1 d PI, while others peak at 5 d PI). Collaborating with Dr. Tim Wiltshire (UNC), we then used the SNPster algorithm for haplotype association mapping (HAM) of maximum RSV response phenotypes. Significant associations were found for MCM, RSV-N mRNA, and BAL monocytes, lymphocytes, and PMNs. False discovery rates were applied to determine significance thresholds for associations. The significant associations were validated independently using FastMap, another HAM algorithm. The most significant association was found on chromosome 1 for BAL monocytes. Within this region are 6 genes that have SNPs that associate with BAL monocytes, including Marco. We identified a non-synonymous coding SNP (rs30741725) that causes a threonine to serine substitution in amino acid 476, and based on predicted protein structure change, this substitution severely affects receptor binding. Further, RSV-induced BAL monocytes and lymphocytes were significantly greater 5 d PI in strains that are homozygous for this SNP relative to strains that have the wild type allele, suggesting a functional role for the mutation in RSV disease. Next, we tested whether targeted deletion of Marco would enhance RSV disease. Relative to Marco+/+ mice, significantly greater histopathological changes (e.g. epithelial sloughing, edema) and numbers of monocytes and PMNs were found in Marco-/- mice 5 d PI providing additional proof-of-concept for a protective role for Marco in RSV disease. We then sought to determine whether our findings in the mouse model translate to human RSV disease. Collaborating with Dr. Fernando Polack, each subject from the RSV cohort (described above) was genotyped for a functional SNP in the MARCO promoter (rs3806496; chrom 2, 119.698574 Mb). Logistic regression was used for analysis where the response variable was O2 saturation. The allele frequency of MARCO (T allele) was 0.47 and in HWE. In the final model, we assumed a log-additive effect in the SNP and adjusted for socioeconomic status (SES), gender, breastfeeding, and breastfeeding*gender. The likelihood ratio test was 16.8 with 1 df, p=4x10-5. The relative risk estimate for the T allele is 0.66 which means that it is protective or the C allele (RR=1.52) is causative. While essential to repeat these findings in another independent population, these novel studies support the hypothesis that MARCO is an important determinant of RSV disease severity, and demonstrates the translational value of the model to understand human RSV disease.',\n",
       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the primary cause of respiratory infection in young children, causing >120,000 hospitalizations in the US annually. RSV vaccine development has been hampered by the history of a failed vaccine trial in the early 1960s in which vaccinated children were not protected against subsequent natural infection but rather experienced more severe disease. Subsequent experiments in animal models and human subjects suggest the occurrence of severe RSV disease correlates with the induction of virus-specific Th2 CD4 T cells and eosinophil recruitment and degranulation. The G glycoprotein of RSV and killed virus vaccines containing adjuvants such as alum induce these types of immune responses associated with the vaccine-enhanced disease syndrome. Dendritic cells are important for processing antigen and initiating immune responses. Understanding their interaction with RSV may reveal the reasons for relatively short-lived immunity induced by natural RSV infection. CD4 T cells can influence and regulate the function of other immune effectors including CD8 T cells. In addition to the potential role of Th2 CD4 T cells in RSV pathogenesis as mentioned above, T regulatory cells have properties that suggest they may be important in RSV immunity and pathogenesis.',\n",
       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and small children.  RSV infection is characterized by significant immunopathology which is mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL).  Past studies have suggested that CD8+ T cells with different functional properties and characteristics can be elicited following infection or immunization, and may have differential effects on viral clearance and RSV-associated illness.  This study seeks to fully characterize CD8+ T responses to RSV, elucidate important factors that dictate the type of CD8+ T cell response that is generated, and understand how other cell types regulate the CD8+ T cell response to result in either a beneficial or a detrimental effect.',\n",
       " 'Plague is a zoonosis that is present in wild rodent populations worldwide and is transmitted primarily by fleas. Yersinia pestis, the plague bacillus, is unique among the enteric group of gram-negative bacteria in having adopted an arthropod-borne route of transmission. Y. pestis has evolved in such a way as to be transmitted during the brief encounter between a feeding flea and a host. A transmissible infection depends on the ability of Y. pestis to grow in the flea as a biofilm that is embedded in a complex extracellular matrix. Bacteria in the biofilm phenotype are deposited into the dermis together with flea saliva, elements which cannot be satisfactorily mimicked by needle-injection of Y. pestis from laboratory cultures. The objective of this project is to identify and determine the function of Y. pestis genes that mediate flea-borne transmission and the initial encounter with the host innate immune system at the infection site in the skin. We study the interaction of Y. pestis with its insect vector by using an artificial feeding apparatus to infect fleas with uniform doses of wild type or specific Y. pestis mutants. We seek to identify Y. pestis genes that are required for the bacteria to infect the flea midgut and to produce a biofilm that blocks the flea foregut and that is required for efficient transmission. The strategy entails first identifying bacterial genes that are differentially expressed in the flea by gene expression analysis and other techniques. Specific mutations are then introduced into these genes, and the mutants tested for their ability to infect and block the flea vector. Identification of such transmission factors allows further studies into the molecular mechanisms of the bacterial infection of the flea vector. Detailed understanding of the interaction with the insect host may lead to novel strategies to interrupt the transmission cycle.\\tDuring the last year, we identified and characterized all the Y. pestis genes predicted to encode enzymes that either synthesize or degrade the bacterial second messenger c-di-GMP, a key regulator of the biofilm life stage of Y. pestis in its flea vector.  We proved that Y. pestis has only two functional genes that function to synthesize c-di-GMP.  We went on to show that the relative contribution of the two genes to the biofilm phenotype is influenced strongly by environmental niche one is most important during infection of the flea, and the other predominates during in vitro growth.  We also continue to investigate the genetic changes that led to the evolutionarily recent transition of Y. pestis to an arthropod-borne transmission route.  Many nonfunctional genes (pseudogenes) occur on the  Y. pestis genome; some of them are implicated in regulating the biofilm phenotype that enhances transmission by fleas.  We have found that restoration of three pseudogenes with the equivalent functional genes of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, the recent ancestor of Y. pestis, reduces transmissibility in the flea; and conversely, mutation of these genes in Y. pseudotuberculosis results in the gain of biofilm-forming ability in the flea.  Thus, gene loss appears to have played a significant role in Y. pestis evolution. We have also further developed models to examine host-parasite interactions in the dermis after transmission by flea bite, and are completing a project on the host immune response to flea saliva and how this influences transmission.  We have established a colony of the ground- and rock-squirrel flea Oropsylla montana, an important vector of plague in the U.S.  We intend to compare transmission efficiency and the biofilm-dependent blockage ability of Y. pestis in X. cheopis and O. montana.',\n",
       " 'We have been able to provide conclusive evidence that the invertebrate stages of Leishmania are fully capable of a sexual cycle during their growth and development in the sand fly vector.   The priority of our studies in 2011 has been to determine the frequency, timing, and anatomical location of hybrid formation within the midgut, and to extend the findings  of sexual competence to other sand fly vector species and other species and strains of Leishmania.  We have been able to recover L. major hybrids from Lutzomyia longipalpis, demonstrating that the main genus of sand flies found in the New World are capable of supporting the sexual reproductive cycle of the Leishmania parasties that they transmit. Hybrids were recovered as early as three days post infection, indicating that early developmental stages, e.g. procyclic and/or nectomonad promastigotes, are sexually competent forms.  We have also been able to successfully cross L. major sub-strains from West Africa and the Middle East that produce substantially different cutaneous pathologies in C57Bl/6 mice, with the former producing complete erosion of the ear dermis and the later producing dermal lesions that fully resolve.   Backcross hybrids generated between F1 progeny and each parental line will be generated to positionally map the parasite genes controlling these clinical outcomes.          To identify parameters of Leishmania infection within a population of infected sand flies that reliably predict subsequent transmission to the mammalian host, in 2011 we sampled many different groups of infected flies and compared infection intensity and degree of metacyclogenesis with the frequency of transmission.  The percentage of parasites within the midgut that were metacyclic promastigotes had the highest correlation with the frequency of transmission.  Meta-analysis of multiple transmission experiments allowed us to establish a percent-metacyclic cutoff value that predicted transmission competence.    Alteration of sand fly oviposition status and environmental conditions at the time of transmission also influenced transmission frequency.  These observations have important implications for transmission of Leishmania by the sand fly vector in the laboratory, as they permit predictions of transmission success in a population of infected flies to be used for critical experiments involving, for example, infected sand fly challenge to evaluate experimental vaccines.  The findings also have important implications for transmission of Leishmania by the sand fly in nature, indicating that the number of organisms acquired by the sand fly from an infection reservoir may influence the dose of transmitted parasites and the clinical outcome of infection following transmission by bite.',\n",
       " 'Research within the Laboratory for Integrative Neuroscience, Section on Synaptic Pharmacology, continues to focus on mechanisms underlying neuromodulation and plasticity and the effects of alcohol and other drugs of abuse on these neuronal functions. Our main interest is the function of the dorsal striatum (DS), a brain region involved in action control and selection, as well as action learning. Long-term depression at striatal GABAergic synapses   We have continued our studies of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) at synapses in striatum.  Previous work in the laboratory indicated that LTD occurs at GABAergic synapses intrinsic to the striatum.  This LTD can be induced by afferent activation at low-moderate frequencies, and requires endocannabinoid signaling.  The two predominant GABAergic inputs to striatal projection neurons (medium spiny neurons or MSNs) come from axon collaterals of other MSNs that synapse mainly on the MSN dendrites, and from the fast-spiking interneurons that synapse mainly near the MSN soma.  We have used optogenetic techniques to activate the two GABAergic inputs independently, by expressing channel rhodopsin 2 selectively in the two neuronal subtypes and activating this channel with light.  This approach has revealed two types of LTD at these GABAergic synapses.  When the membrane potential of the postsynaptic MSN is near the normal resting potential called the  down-state , LTD occurs at both sets of inputs, and does not require activation of voltage-gated calcium channels.  However, when the MSN membrane potential is depolarized to values near the  up-states  seen in vivo, LTD occurs exclusively at MSN-MSN synapses, and appears to involve L-type calcium channel activation.  Under all conditions, LTD is mediated by endocannabinoids acting at CB1 receptors.  Current experiments are exploring the different mechanisms involved in up-state versus down-state GABAergic LTD.  These studies have revealed that endocannabinoids can produce differential patterns of synaptic plasticity depending on the afferent input and the state of the postsynaptic neuron.  These mechanisms have the potential to shape striatal output in multiple ways by differentially affecting inhibition near excitatory synapses on the MSN dendrites, or neuronal activation controlled by GABAergic synapses near the soma. Ethanol actions at striatal GABAergic synapses   We are also continuing our studies of ethanol (EtOH) effects on GABAergic synaptic transmission in dorosolateral (DLS) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS). Our observation that EtOH inhibits GABAergic synaptic transmission in DLS MSNs via a presynaptic mechanism, while potentiating transmission in DMS, suggests differential mechanisms of EtOH action in the two striatal subregions. We are currently using pharmacological approaches, as well as the optogenetic techniques described above, to determine if these differential EtOH effects occur at different afferent inputs to MSNs.  These opposing effects are surprising, and may indicate that EtOH suppresses the output of the DMS that is important for goal-directed actions, while enhancing the output of DLS which is involved in habit formation.   Our continuing studies of chronic EtOH effects in mice and macaque monkeys have revealed synaptic changes that could contribute to prolonged, habitual alcohol use and abuse. In both model organisms, chronic EtOH exposure leads to a maintained decrease in GABAergic synaptic transmission in DLS and DMS (roughly equivalent to putamen and caudate nucleus, respectively, in monkeys).  The findings in monkey are particularly interesting, as the alcohol drinking in this model organism is heavy and prolonged, sharing many features with human drinking.  One notable feature of drinking in these monkeys is that animals develop highly regular alcohol intake with increased duration of intake bouts after 2 years of drinking, and the blood alcohol levels they achieve gradually escalate over a three year period.  The decreased GABAergic transmission we have observed in putamen MSNs from these monkeys is strongly correlated with the average alcohol intake for each individual monkey.  We have also observed increases in glutamatergic synaptic transmission and increased numbers of dendritic spines (the sites of glutamatergic synapses) in the putamen of the chronic EtOH-drinking monkeys.  Intrinsic neuronal excitability is also increased after prolong drinking in the putamen MSNs.  Recent findings have extended our knowledge by showing that GABAergic synaptic changes are greater in monkeys with earlier onset of drinking, a known risk factor for human alcohol use disorders. The synaptic changes that we have observed in these monkeys appear to render the putamen nucleus hyperexcitable, due to a combination of decreased GABAergic inhibition and increased intrinsic and glutamatergic synaptic excitability.  Given the role of the putamen and associated circuitry in development and production of repetitive habitual actions, we hypothesize that the hyperexcitable putamen contributes to maintained, invariant patterns of drinking with high alcohol loading observed in the monkeys.   We are also continuing to study effects of fetal/early-postnatal EtOH exposure on striatal function. This project was stimulated by reports implicating altered corticostriatal function in humans with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). We are using vapor exposure to EtOH during gestation and the early postnatal period.  Electrophysiological experiments have revealed decreased GABAergic synaptic transmission in DLS MSNs examined in adult mice following fetal/early postnatal EtOH exposure.  The normal decrease in GABAergic transmission produced by acute exposure to EtOH is lost in these mice, suggesting development of some sort of tolerance to EtOH actions.  Interestingly, the synaptic depression normally produced by CB1 receptor activation is also lost in the fetal/early postnatal EtOH-exposed mouse DLS MSNs.  Preliminary studies indicate that this effect is selective for CB1 in comparison to to other presynaptic G protein-coupled receptors, and that an abnormal tonic activation of CB1 receptors by eCBs may occur as a consequence of this early life EtOH exposure.  Our parallel behavioral studies indicate that this early-life EtOH exposure also impairs habit learning in the mice, and disrupts the associated changes in striatal neuronal activity.  These experiments have revealed changes in striatal synaptic transmission that could contribute to abnormalities in the corticostriatal circuitry seen in FASD.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV continues to infect human populations worldwide, emphasizing the need for epidemiological tools that can accurately describe transmission patterns. Thus, the methods we will develop will have specific impact on HIV vaccines; evolution; epidemiological parameters: spread of infection in different groups; intervention; and more generally on the fundamental science of infectious diseases. The overall goal is to understand the relationship between virus evolution and its epidemiological history, and to create epidemiological tools that can make reliable contact tracings and assess changes in epidemic dynamics. We have recently shown that the epidemic rate is inversely correlated to the virus evolutionary rate on the population level. Thus, the specific hypothesis behind the proposed research is that there is a relationship between the speed at which an epidemic moves through a human population and the rate at which the virus evolves in that population. We have observed that there are discrepancies between transmission histories and viral phylogenies, and because the inferences of epidemics are based on phylogenetics, it becomes important to understand the limitations in such inferences. Based on this the specific aims of this proposal are to: 1. Create a model that accurately describes the connection between transmission history and viral phylogeny. Preliminary results suggest that there are  hidden lineages  in viral phylogenies that are involved in transmission events, potentially misleading reconstruction of transmission events. We will especially investigate the effects of the effective population size in the donor, the bottleneck at transmission, and incomplete lineage sorting during transmission and sampling. We aim to estimate meaningful confidence levels on reconstructed person-to-person transmissions enabling us to explore alternative hypotheses in a statistical framework specifically designed for epidemiological tracking. 2. Identify the mechanism that correlates epidemic rate and virus evolutionary rate. We will decipher the connection between epidemic rate and viral evolutionary rate. Currently, we have four alternative explanations that may cause the observed correlation between epidemic and evolutionary rate (host immune selection, viral generation time effects, selection during transmission, and recombination effects). We will use different gene sequence data, codon positions as well as amino acid signatures to discriminate between these hypothetical explanations. We will use large datasets to develop epidemiological models that include these four hypothetical explanations to investigate their effects on the population level, and also model social networks and epidemic and phylogeographic dynamics.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The mathematical methods developed in this project aim to give better inferences of the spread of pathogens, here mainly HIV. At the contact tracing level we will estimate meaningful confidence levels on reconstructed person-to-person transmissions enabling us to explore alternative hypotheses in a statistical framework specifically designed for epidemiological tracking. At the epidemic level we will develop methods that can follow and signal when important changes in spread patterns occur, including the origin of the infection.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long term goal is to elucidate mechanisms by which respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes lung dysfunction. In the USA, RSV hospitalizes >100K infants/year. Pulmonary mucus is a hallmark of RSV disease. Mucus mixed with epithelial cell debris blocks the airways. Mechanisms by which RSV infection induces airway mucus are not known. Goals of this proposal are to define the role of the viral fusion (F) proteins of mucus-inducing RSV strains in pathogenesis and to define the roles of neutrophils and basophils in RSV-induced mucus. In contrast to laboratory RSV strains, RSV strains line 19 and 2-20 induce mucus and bronchiolitis in mice. Using a RSV reverse genetics system, we showed that the F protein of line 19 plays a role in mucus induction. We identified five amino acids in the line 19 F protein as candidates for involvement in mucus induction. We will use F mutant viruses to define line 19 F residues that are important for mucus expression in vivo. RSV 2- 20 is virulent in mice. We hypothesize that RSV 2-20 F contributes to airway mucus and virulence. We will define the role of 2-20 F in pathogenesis using 2-20F-chimeric RSV. Line 19 and 2-20 cause greater epithelial cell cytopathic effect (CPE) and desquamation in vivo than lab RSV strains. We will use F mutants to define effects of RSV line 19 F and 2-20 F on epithelial cell CPE, syncytia, and desquamation in vivo and in vitro. We will define the fusogenicity of RSV line 19, 2-20, and lab strain F proteins in epithelial cells in vitro using a fusion assay. We hypothesize that line 19 F and 2-20 F induce greater syncytia and fusion in vivo and in vitro. The study will also determine the roles of neutrophils and basophils in RSV bronchiolitis. Concurrently wih epithelial cell damage, RSV line 19 and 2-20 induce neutrophilia in the lungs of mice. We hypothesize that neutrophils contribute to viral clearance and mucus expression in line 19 and 2-20 pathogenesis. Line 19- induced mucus is dependent on IL-13, a TH2 cytokine. IL 4 is the primary TH2-driving cytokine. We showed that basophils are the major IL 4-expressing cell type in RSV-infection. We hypothesize that basophils contribute to RSV line 19- and 2-20-induced IL-13 and mucus expression. These RSV bronchiolitis models will advance our understanding of RSV strain-dependent pathogenesis and may lead to much-needed therapies.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RSV causes >100,000 infant hospitalizations in the US each year and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and viral death in infants. Mucus production is a hallmark feature of RSV disease, leading to airway obstruction, hypoxia, and mechanical ventilation. Mechanisms of RSV-induced mucus are unknown and the focus of this proposal. Elucidation of these mechanisms will identify targets for therapies',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is currently no vaccine or standard treatment for RSV. However there is clearly an unmet medical need: RSV is responsible for approximately 100,000 hospitalizations per year in the U.S. alone, and is globally responsible for more than 150,000 deaths per year. The continued absence of vaccines and standard treatments for RSV disease represents an important and serious gap in preventive medicine. In response to RFA AI-09-016, investigators from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc., and Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center are proposing a partnership to expedite RSV vaccine development. Recombinant murine Sendai virus (SeV) expressing RSV F glycoprotein (rSeV-RSV-F) is an extremely attractive candidate for an RSV vaccine. This xenotropic vaccine elicits rapid and durable protection against RSV in an animal model and is associated with no enhanced immunopathology upon RSV infection. Since an RSV vaccine will need to protect infants, and since maternal antibodies can reduce the efficacy of replicating and non-replicating vaccines, fundamental questions concerning vaccine-antibody interactions must be addressed prior to clinical development of rSeV-RSV-F. Our Central Hypothesis is that the rSeV-RSV-F vaccine will confer RSV protection to infants, even in the presence of maternal antibodies. Our Specific Aims are: (1) To determine the relative functional titers of anti-SeV (PIV1) and anti-RSV antibodies in human infants, (2) To determine the influence of maternal antibodies on rSeV-RSV-F vaccine efficacy (in a cotton rat model), and (3) To optimize vaccine by formulation and regimen. When optimized vaccine doses/formulations/regimens are identified, these will be further tested: (i) to ensure the absence of enhanced immunopathology, (ii) to measure response durability, and (iii) to measure immune correlates of protection. Data from these experiments will have broad application to the pediatric vaccine field, and will be critical to the launch of clinical trials with rSeV-RSV-F.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of severe lower respiratory tract illness in infants and the elderly. Currently, no safe and efficacious RSV vaccine exists. Advances in our understanding of immunity and disease pathogenesis associated with infection have shown that RSV G protein contains a CX3C chemokine motif that interacts with the CX3CR1 chemokine receptor, modifies the activities of CX3CL1, and affects aspects of immunity and disease pathogenesis. Antibodies directed to the CX3C motif inhibit G protein CX3C-CX3CR1 interaction and reduce disease pathogenesis. The long- term goal of our research is to develop a novel nanocapsule vaccine engineered to carry a RSV G protein polypeptide that we have previously shown to induce neutralizing and disease protective antibody. The nanocapsule technology is attractive for vaccine development as it targets professional antigen- presenting cells which we have shown to improve the immunogenicity of both T cell and antibody target epitopes. The proposal will take advantage of well-defined assays and a mouse model to: (1) Identify the optimal CX3C motif vaccine antigen sequence based on G polypeptide vaccination of mice and evaluation of G protein CX3C-CX3CR1 blocking antibody responses, (2) Construct nanocapsule vaccine candidates with the appropriate G polypeptide and demonstrate immunogenicity and protection in a mouse model, (3) Use optimized, efficacious nanocapsule vaccines to further understand the disease modifying effect of antibodies that block G protein CX3C-CX3CR1 interaction and disease pathogenesis, 4) Evaluate parameters of safety and duration of vaccine efficacy in the memory response to (G peptide nanocapsule vaccination and RSV challenge, and (5) Evaluate the safety and efficacy of G peptide nanocapsule vaccine in the context of pre-existing RSV immunity. The proposed research is innovative because it will identify regions in the RSV G protein that induce antibodies which neutralize infection and block RSV disease, incorporate the optimal polypeptide in an novel nanocapsule-based vaccine candidate that targets antigen-presenting cells, and will provide long-term protection against RSV strains. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most important cause of sever lower respiratory tract illness in infants and the elderly. Currently, no safe and efficacious RSV vaccine exists. The long-term goal of our research is to develop a novel nanocapsule vaccine engineered to carry a RSV G protein polypeptide that we have previously shown to induce neutralizing and disease protective antibody.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today, the majority of new HIV-1 infections result from heterosexual transmission with HIV-1 CCR5-using, R5 strains. However, there is a tight bottleneck during transmission so that only a single virus variant is transmitted in about 80% of infections. It is not known whether the transmitted viruses carry an advantage over strains that fail to transmit. However, R5 envelopes vary extensively in different properties that are likely to have a strong impact on HIV-1 transmission. These properties include (1) macrophage-tropism, (2) capacity to infect cells via low levels of CCR5 and (3) decreased sensitivity to CCR5 ligands including chemokines. Our hypothesis is that HIV-1 transmission is conferred by envelopes with distinct properties that confer an advantage for transmission. We propose the following aims. Aim 1: To investigate whether transmitted founder/acute envelopes form a distinct subset with particular properties: We will investigate HIV-1 R5 clade B and C envs for the three properties described above. We will include envs from the acute stage of infection including founder envelopes that closely represent transmitted strains. We will compare with R5 envelopes from later disease stages that cover the wide variation in the properties to be investigated. Aim 1 experiments will thus reveal whether transmitted founder/acute envelopes form a distinct subset with a particular set of properties. Aim 2: To evaluate whether founder/acute or other R5 envelopes with specific properties confer an enhanced tropism for Langerhan's cells or ectocervical explant cultures as a model for male-to-female transmission: We will investigate the R5 founder/acute envelopes as well as later disease stage envelopes that cover the variation documented in aim 1. These envelopes will be tested for infection of different DC (including LCs) and ectocervical explant cultures and investigated for trans-infection of T-cells via DCs. Together, these experiments will help elucidate how different env properties impact on transmission. Aim 3: To identify the envelope determinants that confer efficient infection of ectocervical explant cultures: We will map envelope determinants that confer efficient infection of ectocervical explant cultures. Our proposal will provide the first comprehensive study of how variation in the properties of R5 envs of different clades impacts on their capacity to infect different DC subsets and ectocervical explant cultures as a model for male-to-female transmission. Importantly, we will identify env properties and determinants that confer efficient transmission. The data obtained will provide new insights into the mechanisms of transmission and help identify vulnerabilities in transmitter envelopes that can be targeted by microbicides and vaccines.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our application proposes an extensive investigation into the biological properties of HIV-1 viruses that are transmitted. We will use infection of vaginal and cervical cultures as a model of sexual transmission to evaluate which HIV-1 characteristics confer the most efficient infection. Identification of the viral properties and determinants that confer infection of such cultures will provide new insights into the mechanisms of transmission. Our data will help identify vulnerabilities of transmitting viruses that can be targeted by microbicides and vaccines designed to elicit protection against global HIV-1.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) has emerged as a significant global epidemic and poses a particular threat to HIV-infected persons. Drug-resistant TB disease is predominantly thought to develop as a result of selection pressure for drug-resistant mutant bacilli ( amplified resistance ). Drug-resistant TB disease may also occur, however, from exposure to and infection with a TB strain which is already drug-resistant ( primary transmission ). Transmission of drug-resistant TB strains has been well-described in congregate settings, such as hospitals containing highly immunocompromised patients, but few studies have evaluated population-level transmission of drug-resistant TB, and none have done so in a high HIV prevalence setting. The collision of XDR TB and HIV in South Africa offers a unique, early opportunity to study these dual epidemics, which are anticipated to converge in other countries in the future. The current global crisis of drug-resistant TB is due to both amplified resistance and primary transmission, although the relative contribution of each is unknown. In Aim 1 of this application, we propose a prospective, population-based, cross-sectional study to determine the proportion of new XDR TB cases which develop due to primary transmission as opposed to amplified resistance in Tugela Ferry district, a rural area of South Africa with exceedingly high rates of XDR TB and HIV co-infection. We hypothesize that over three-quarters of XDR TB cases arise due to primary transmission. In Aim 2, we will combine molecular genotyping with contact tracing and social network analysis to provide insights into the relationships between XDR TB subjects with matching strain genotypes ( clusters ) and the locations where TB transmission may be occurring. We expect to identify that transmission is occurring in not only healthcare, but also community congregate settings. The findings from this study will lead to a better understanding of XDR TB transmission patterns in the Tugela Ferry community, which is critical for targeting interventions to curb the ongoing XDR TB epidemic. The proposed study will be the first to integrate epidemiologic, molecular, and social network analytic methods to study TB transmission in a high HIV prevalence setting. The interactions between HIV infection and drug-resistant TB have been identified as a priority research area by the NIH and the Federal TB Task Force, specifically epidemiologic research and greater use of genotyping to improve understanding of HIV and drug-resistant TB, and implementation of intensive contact tracing and outbreak investigation. This application will address these issues directly and take place at the epicenter of the convergent epidemics of TB, HIV, and drug-resistant TB in rural South Africa, where our research group has been working since 2002. Continuous, population-level surveillance for XDR TB, including culture and drug-susceptibility testing for all TB suspects in Tugela Ferry district, creates a unique opportunity to study XDR TB transmission.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Effective prevention of XDR TB, a disease characterized by extremely high mortality, especially in HIV-infected patients, is crucial to controlling the current epidemic and will require understanding patterns of transmission in both healthcare and community settings. This study, which combines classic contact investigation with advanced molecular epidemiologic techniques and social network analysis, will examine XDR TB transmission patterns in a high-HIV-prevalent, rural, resource-limited setting. Findings will help improve the health of individuals and communities affected by the XDR TB epidemic and will create an evidence-base to guide sound public health policy for XDR TB disease prevention throughout the developing world.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the search for a vaccine and a cure for HIV-1 are ongoing, new prevention strategies are needed. Two possibilities are microbicides and pre-exposure prophylaxis. Both have shown only partial efficacy in clinical trials. The basis for theseresults, in particular for the CAPRISA 004 trial, are uncertain but likely include poor adherence. Based on our recent results, one additional possibility could be a lack of protection from cell-associated transmission. Specifically, vaginal exposure of humanized mice with HIV-1 infected cells resulted in successful infection of 9/10 mice. Having established this cell-associated HIV-1 transmission model, we next replicated the CAPRISA 004 experimental approach and determined if vaginal administration of anti-HIV drug tenofovir inhibits cell-associated HIV-1 infection. Surprisingly, we found tenofovir treatment resulted in only 33% protection against cell-associated HIV-1. This highly contrasts with our observation with cell-free HIV-1 which demonstrated 88% protection with tenofovir. These striking results have significant implications for the development of preventative approaches since they suggest that methods that effectively prevent cell-free HIV-1 transmission may not prevent cell-associated HIV-1 transmission. Therefore, it is of great importance to implement and validate in vivo models of cell-associated HIV-1 transmission that can be used to identify drug strategies that are effective at preventing both modes of HIV-1 infection. Based on this compelling preliminary data, the fundamental hypothesis that will be tested is that cell-associated HIV-1 transmission is more efficient than cell-free virus and is less susceptible to microbicides due to the ability to migrate away from thevaginal vault. This hypothesis will be tested by determining the relative efficacy of transmission by cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1. Microbicides using different anti-viral drugs that target different steps of the HIV-1 life cycle will also be evaluated for the ability to prevent cell-associated HIV-1 transmission. Finally, we will evaluate pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) based strategies for their ability to determine if they can block cell-associated HIV as well. By determining which drugs and administration methods are effective, we can gain insight on the potential mechanisms of cell-associated HIV-1 transmission. The results of these studies will likely influence the future design of HIV-1 prevention strategies.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-1 continues to be a global problem and we are lacking effective strategies to prevent its spread. We believe that cell-associated HIV contributes to HIV transmission in humans. This study proposes to establish the role of cell-associated HIV-1 transmission in vivo using the BLT humanized mice model. The results of these studies have the potential to great impact the design of future HIV-1 prevention strategies that would lead to decreased rates of HIV transmission and improved global health.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, interventions were conducted in an effort to limit transmission, including school closure, vaccination and antiviral prophylaxis. By and large, these approaches were meant to reduce the population level transmission of disease, rather than to protect specific individuals from infection. Using current methods, it is difficult to measure how effective such interventions were. Conducting a randomized controlled trial is difficult due to the unknown timing and location of outbreaks, as well as being ethically problematic. However, quantifying intervention effects is important. Knowing the extent to which transmission is reduced by particular control measures can help us to determine how many cases can be prevented by a particular approach, and whether the approach is sufficient to interrupt (rather than simply reduce) disease spread. Also, interventions are not without both direct and indirect social and financial costs. Deciding whether the effect of an intervention justifies its cost depends on the size of the expected effect and the severity of the disease being prevented. Finally, modern approaches to disease control and public health planning rely extensively on models of disease transmission. These models are only as good as their inputs, one of the most important of which is the effectiveness of any planned intervention. While mechanistic approaches to quantifying intervention effects may be useful, they are assumption laden and could be much improved by measures of the real world reduction in population level transmission provided by these interventions.  The objective of the proposed research is to quantify the effects of interventions on the transmission dynamics of influenza through the development and validation of statistical techniques and enhanced study designs. Specifically, we aim to (1) estimate the effect of prophylactic use of antivirals combined with reactive vaccination on influenza transmission in long term care facilities, (2) estimate the effectiveness of social distancing measures to control influenza transmission in Thailand, and (3) develop and validate enhanced study designs for the investigation of outbreaks of influenza and other pathogens. The methods and techniques used to answer these questions will be widely applicable to other diseases (particularly respiratory viruses), and will provide researchers with new tools to investigate transmission dynamics and identify new methods of disease control.  The proposed research is part of a K22 award. Prior to receiving the award the PI candidate will continue to work in his post-doctoral position under the supervision of Dr. Derek Cummings on research into the understanding and modeling of infectious disease. This research will be conducted under two grants,  Immune landscapes of human influenza in households, towns and cities in southern China  (NIH, 1 R01 TW 0008246-01) and the  Vaccine Modeling Initiative  (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). In his role in the Immune Landscapes project, the applicant will be involved in the collection of serological data on influenza infection from Guang Dong province, China, and the analysis of this data. This work will further his understanding of both the science and practicalities of infectious disease research. In the Vaccine Modeling Initiative, the applicant will work closely with Dr. Cummings and Dr. Bryan Grenfell in an analysis of the effectiveness of reactive vaccination in cholera outbreaks, thereby increasing his abilities in the modeling of infectious disease and the assessment of intervention effects. In addition, the candidate will continue to consult with his mentors Dr. Ron Brookmeyer (on statistical matters), and Dr. Charlotte Gaydos (on laboratory topics and virology). The experience and guidance he receives from this postdoctoral work will leave the candidate well prepared to both succeed in the proposed research and as an independent investigator.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVENCE: An understanding of the dynamics of influenza transmission and the effectiveness of interventions in mitigating it is important due to the threat of emerging pandemic strains as wells as the high burden of endemic disease. This project aims to study the transmission dynamics of influenza and the effect of interventions through the development and application of statistical techniques and novel study designs. This research will provide a direct benefit to public health by estimating the effect of commonly used interventions and fundamental characteristics of influenza transmission.',\n",
       " 'In this continuation application/progress report for an R37 MERIT Award, the progress on the two majorspecific aims is reviewed. The overall goal of the work is to use HIV-1 sequence diversity to examine thebiological determinants of transmission and pathogenesis. These studies will inform our understanding ofthe transmission and disease processes. The first aim covering the study of samples from an HIV-1 verticaltransmission cohort Is nearing completion. A major feature of the remaining work is to create molecularclones of the env genes from maternal and infant viral populations to test the rote of autologous neutralizingantibodies in vertical transmission. This work will test the hypothesis that a neutralization escape variant isresponsible for vertical transmission. In addition, these studies will reveal the complexity of the virus invertical transmission and provide reagents to study other biological properties of the transmitted virus. Thesecond aim on horizontal transmission is still awaiting the availability of samples from people in acuteinfection from southem Braal. Given progress in the field this aim is now refined to focus on the question ofthe relative fitness of subtype B and subtype C viruses Involved in acute infection and coclrculating in thesame population. This analysis is designed to address the question of whether differences in relative viralfitness play a role in the subtype B and C epidemics. Studies in viral diversity are in part framed by thetechnology available to study that diversity. Two important and complementary technologies for studyingdiversity are the heteroduplex tracking assay (HTA) and the single genome amplification (SGA) approach.The new technology of deep sequencing has not been approriately applied to the study of viral diversity dueto intrinsic problems of PCR resampling. A new strategy will be applied to overcome this problem to allowthe accurate use of this new technology to study viral diversity using HIV as the test case This will provide athird complementary approach to the study of viral diversity. The application of these strategies in ways thatcould inform clinical care will also be explored. Finally, collaborative opportunities have been developed tostudy viral evolution in a humanized mouse model and under the influence of AP0BEC3G/F and will becontinued.RELEVANCE (See Instmctions):HIV sequence diversity is a rich source of biological infonnation about the selective pressures placed on thevirus and changes in virus-host interactions. We are using viral sequence diversity to explore questionsimportant for vertical and horizontal transmission and the evolution of pathogenic variants after transmission.In addition, we continue to develop new technologies to derive more information from complex viralpopulations.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Incomplete understanding as to how HIV influences TB transmission dynamics in Africa represents a major gap in knowledge and a significant obstacle to disrupting TB transmission. Characterizing recent TB transmission networks, identifying sites of ongoing TB transmission, and understanding how HIV influences TB transmission are all critical steps in developing novel, strategic intensified TB case-finding approaches in Africa. Our central hypotheses are that the majority of recent TB transmission in this high HIV prevalence setting takes place in community gathering and health care sites, as opposed to households, and HIV-infected persons are at significantly increased risk of recent TB transmission compared to HIV-uninfected persons. The objectives of the current proposal are the following: Aim 1: Identify and characterize recent TB transmission networks in an East African rural setting. We will perform molecular epidemiologic analysis of all diagnosed, culture-positive TB cases initiating TB therapy in Tororo Municipality over 3 years (~360) in order to identify recent TB transmission networks defined by genotypic clustering of TB isolates. Aim 2: Locate sites of frequent TB transmission through analysis of the geographic distribution and social networks of genotype-clustered incident TB cases. We will combine molecular epidemiologic, geospatial and social network data to identify TB transmission  hot spots , characterized by high levels of TB transmission. These  hot spots  may occur in commercial, social (e.g. markets, bars, churches), or health care settings. We will investigate how HIV influences where TB is transmitted at a community level Aim 3: Pilot test a place-based intensified TB case-finding strategy at two identified locations of high TB transmission risk. Through a focused program of mentored training and coursework, the candidate will develop advanced skills in molecular epidemiology, Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis and the spatial analysis of epidemiologic data, social network analysis, and the conduct of prospective clinical studies in resource-limited settings. These scientific and career aims will serve as the basis for the long term research goal of conducting large, community-wide trials of targeted intensified TB case-finding in sub-Saharan Africa in order to reduce TB mortality and transmission among HIV-infected and uninfected persons.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this career development award is for Dr. Philip A. Chan to acquire the training and experience necessary to become an independent clinical investigator. The career goals of this proposal are to gain expertise in the field of HIV-oriented molecular epidemiology including familiarity with biostatistics and study design, to become skilled using molecular phylogenetics to study HIV transmission patterns and population dynamics, to acquire experience in HIV behavior and prevention sciences, and to receive proper training in the Responsible Conduct of Research including ethical practices. The number of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected individuals continues to increase in the United States, propagated by transmission in social networks among high-risk groups. Identification of networks within which HIV transmission occurs can lead to targeted screening and effective prevention interventions. Current HIV epidemiologic contact tracing programs implemented by public health departments are often limited by reporting and recall bias secondary to the lag time between infection and diagnosis as well as the reluctance of HIV-infected individuals to report partners. This research proposal integrates molecular epidemiology and public health programs to identify transmission networks and develop behavior assessment and intervention tools. In collaboration with other major academic centers in Rhode Island and the Department of Health, molecular epidemiology will be used to enhance contact tracing programs and develop future targeted prevention strategies. The objectives of the research are to: 1) Identify transmission networks among HIV- infected individuals using molecular phylogenetic approaches; 2) Determine risk factors and characteristics associated with transmission networks that may be targeted for interventions; and 3) Identify contacts of individuals forming transmission networks to diagnose HIV-infected yet unaware cases, characterize risk behaviors, and assess acceptability of novel prevention interventions. This research will allow a comprehensive investigation of HIV epidemiology and development of an effective public health model that can be implemented elsewhere. During the course of this award, Dr. Chan will be mentored by experts from Brown University in the field of molecular genetics and HIV epidemiology including Dr. Rami Kantor (primary mentor) and Dr. Kenneth Mayer.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long range goal of the proposed work is to understand the fundamental relationships between climate and vector-borne pathogen transmission. We will use more than a decade of research and data at multiple scales on the transmission ecology of West Nile virus (WNV) to determine mechanistic relationships of climate on mosquito populations and WNV transmission and the potential impacts of climate change. The proposed work addresses three specific aims: SA1) Determine the broad scale spatio-temporal correlations between rainfall and temperature and West Nile virus incidence in humans, mosquitoes, and birds, while controlling for land use. Use these patterns to generate mechanistic hypotheses about local scale processes generating these correlations. We will use more than a decade of WNV incidence in birds, mosquitoes, and humans to determine the influence of temperature and rainfall on the length of WNV transmission season, the spatial distribution of WNV, and the intensity of WNV transmission. SA2) Test mechanistic hypotheses about climate-transmission links with laboratory studies and local scale data on temperature, rainfall, host abundance and WNV seroprevalence, and mosquito abundance, feeding patterns, and WNV infection prevalence. We will perform laboratory studies to determine the influence of temperature on four critical factors in the transmission of vector-borne pathogens: vector competence, developmental rate, longevity, and biting rate of the three dominant WNV mosquito species. We will use local studies of WNV transmission at 182 sites in 6 regions spanning the east-west and north-south dimensions of the USA to determine the influence of rainfall and temperature on mosquito abundance and the intensity of WNV transmission relative to other factors. SA3) Use hypotheses supported from SA2 to predict the impacts of climate change on future WNV transmission. We will develop fine scale future climate projections and use the insights gained from aims 1&2 to predict the effects of climate change on the distribution of WNV in North America, the length of the WNV transmission season, and the intensity of transmission across the USA.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Climate change presents important risks for human health, including, vector-borne, water-borne, and food-borne disease, heat stress, air pollution, extreme weather events. The impact of climate on vector-borne disease is one of the more difficult issues to address, because increasing temperature and changes in rainfall can have both positive and negative impacts on pathogen transmission, making simple directional predictions tenuous. As a result, determining the impact of climate change on vector-borne disease requires a multi-scale approach where the mechanisms of climate impacts on local scale transmission can determined, followed by a scaling up of these mechanisms to a scale that is relevant for public health. Current and previous work on West Nile virus presents an opportunity to attack the problem head-on with this multi- scale approach, which will facilitate public health intervention for this, and other vector-borne diseases.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV transmission via breastfeeding accounts for nearly half of the 350,000 infant HIV infections occurring annually. While HIV is readily transmitted from mother-to-child via breastfeeding, it has been recognized both observationally and experimentally that SIV is not or is only rarely transmitted through breastfeeding to infants of natural hosts of SIV. This lack of SIV transmission via breastfeeding is not attributable to lowvirus RNA load in the breast milk compartment, as maternal milk virus load in nonpathogenic SIV infection is similar to that of HIV and pathogenic SIV infection. Therefore, the infants of natural hosts of SIV are highly exposed, uninfected population, warranting evaluation of the factors contributing to the impediment of virus transmission in this setting. Elucidation of mechanisms that evolved to protect breastfeeding infants of natural hosts of SIV from postnatal SIV infection will inform immunologic strategies to reduce HIV transmission via breastfeeding. Importantly, we identified robust autologous virus neutralizing antibody response in milk of AGMs. In contrast, an autologous virus neutralization response is not detectable in milk of SIV-infected RMs or HIV-infected women. This effective virus-specific mucosal antibody response in milk of AGMs may impede virus transmission in the infant oral/gastrointestinal tract. Our previous work isolating HIV Envelope-specific monoclonal antibodies from colostrum B cells of HIV-infected women has identified novel HIV Env-specific neutralizing mucosal antibodies produced in the setting of chronic HIV infection. Therefore, identification of SIV Env-specific memory B cell responses in breast milk of nontransmitting natural hosts of SIV will define novel virus-specific mucosal antibody functions that may effectively block of mucosal virus transmission to a highly exposed, uninfected infant population, in contrast to the B cell responses of pathogenic SIV and HIV infection. This proposal is being submitted in response to the NIAID Program Announcement PA-11-217  Mechanistic Studies of HIV-exposed Seronegative Individuals , specifically addressing the topic of mucosal parameters that are distinctly different in the resistant population (SIV-infected AGM mother- infant pairs) compared to the nonresistant population (SIV-infected RMs and HIV-infected humans mother-infant pairs).  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV transmission via breastfeeding accounts for nearly half of the 350,000 infant HIV infections occurring annually. Impeding postnatal HIV transmission, while maintaining the nutritional and immune benefits of breastfeeding, is critical to improving HIV-freesurvival of infants in regions of high HIV prevalence. Mechanisms that protect infants from postnatal virus acquisition have evolved in natural hosts of SIV, a phenomenon that is not attributable to limited virus exposure. Moreover, a potent neutralizing antibody response was detected in breast milk of natural hosts of SIV, a response that is absent in postnatal-transmitting monkey species and HIV-infected humans. Therefore, defining the immunologic mechanisms contributing to protection of infants of natural hosts of SIV from virus acquisition will guide the development of interventions to prevent HIV transmission via breastfeeding.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is my goal to become an independent investigator studying the epidemiology of bacterial infections and the role of bacterial genetic diversity in transmission, pathogenesis, and disease outcome. I envision that my research program will have three interconnected arms: epidemiologic studies involving collection of bacterial samples, investigation of genetic diversity of the bacterial samples and its association with clinical and epidemiological characteristics, and study of the functional impact of the observed genetic diversity. I have gained experience in conducting studies of bacterial genetic diversity and its clinical, epidemiological, and functional relevance through my doctoral work and my post-doctoral training so far. However, I have not yet had any experience in conducting epidemiologic studies that involve collecting bacterial samples and participant data and consider this a major gap in my training and ability to attain my career goals. To fill this gap in my training, I have crafted a research proposal that will allow me to obtain important experience in the design of an epidemiologic study, recruitment of study participants, and collection of biological specimens and subject data under the supervision and guidance of mentors who have extensive experience in conducting these types of studies. The career development plan takes advantage of the variety of expertise among faculty members at The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), an institution that fosters interdisciplinary research. The proposed research, which integrates epidemiology and molecular biology, will be supervised by a mentoring committee that includes a molecular and cell biologist and H. pylori expert (Dr. Nina Salama, mentor), two epidemiologists (Dr. Johanna Lampe, co-mentor, and Dr. Thomas Vaughan), and a biostatistician (Dr. Sarah Holte). I will meet with my mentor weekly and with my co-mentor at least twice monthly to discuss details of the research study. Twice yearly, I will meet with my entire mentoring committee to present my research progress and discuss future steps for my research and career development. In addition to support from my mentoring committee members, I will take advantage of both the scientific and career development seminars held at FHCRC and the University of Washington. The proposed research is a study of H. pylori transmission within families and the bacterial genetic changes that occur during adaptation to a new host. H. pylori transmission predominantly occurs within families, but it is not known if this is attributable to the sustained close contacts between family members or because the genetic relatedness of the family members facilitates transmission. Bacterial adaptations to the individual host that occur during H. pylori's decades-long infection may cause the strain to be better able to colonize a genetically similar host. H. pylori has many mechanisms for genetic diversification, which likely aids the bacterium in adapting to the newly infected host after transmission. Diversification of genes that encode H. pylori cell surface structures that interact with the host is especially likely to be important during adaptation to a new host. In this grant, test the hypothesis that H. pylori transmission predominantly occurs within families because an H. pylori strain that is adapted to the individual host is better able to colonize a genetically similar host. Furthermore, I test the hypothesis that H. pylori will undergo more genetic diversification when being transmitted between unrelated individuals than between related individuals. Aim 1 proposes to collect stool samples from members of families with biological children and families with adopted children, genotype H. pylori from the stool DNA, and compare the extent of H. pylori genotype sharing, which indicates transmission, between the two different types of families using statistical analysis. In Aim 2, H. pylori DNA isolated from family members who share the same H. pylori strain will be compared by PCR and DNA sequencing to look for genetic changes to genes involved in bacterial-host interactions that would affect expression or function of the encoded protein. The extent of genetic changes within H. pylori strain pairs shared by related and unrelated family members will then be examined. The proposed research will result in important information about the patterns of H. pylori transmission within families and the contribution of shared host genetics versus household contact to transmission. Further knowledge of the factors involved in H. pylori transmission will inform strategies for preventing and treating new infections. The proposed research will also result in an improved understanding of the genetic diversification and adaptation of H. pylori to anew host, allowing the bacteria to maintain an active, persistent infection in the face of host defenses and eventually cause ulcers and stomach cancer.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Helicobacter pylori causes ulcers and stomach cancer in a subset of those who are infected. The proposed research will result in important information about the patterns of H. pylori transmission within families and adaptation of H. pylori to a new host. Further knowledge of the factors involved in H. pylori transmission and its ability to maintain an active, persistent infection in the face of host defenses will inform strategies for preventing and treating new infections.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a noncytopathic, hepatotropic DNA virus that causes acute and chronic hepatitis and kills a million people each year from cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently approved therapies for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B include two classes of drugs: interferon and a small number of nucleos(t)ide analogues. However, the indication and response to interferon therapy is poor and associated with severe adverse effects and nucleos(t)ide analogues therapy is frequently associated with the emergence of single- and cross-drug-resistant HBV mutants. Thus, developing a new interferon- and/or nucleos(t)ide analogue-independent therapy is the long-term objective of this application. Antisense-mediated degradation of viral RNA represents such a novel class of antiviral therapy and this approach has been successfully pursued by our collaborator Isis Pharmaceuticals and resulted in a commercialized drug (fomivirsen) targeting cytomegalovirus. Using the same principal, our collaborators at Isis Pharmaceuticals have now identified lead candidate antisense molecules that efficiently inhibit HBV replication in cell culture. Studying the HBV life cycle and its inhibition by antiviral drugs has been and still is hampered by the lack of suitable and widely available in vivo HBV replication and infection systems. I have extensive experience using HBV transgenic mice that express and replicate HBV from an integrated viral genome to study viral gene expression, replication, virus production and inhibition of these steps by interferon-mediated antiviral mechanism. Furthermore, together with our collaborators at the Salk Institute, we have recently demonstrated efficient HBV and hepatitis C virus infection in a novel chimeric mouse model repopulated with human hepatocytes that allows us to study all steps of the viral life cycle during long-term infections. The goal of this application is to use these in vivo HBV replication and infection model systems to further evaluate and improve the therapeutic value and characteristics of the lead candidate antisense molecules targeting HBV. In specific aim 1 we will establish the lead candidate's toxicity and pharmacokinetic profile, demonstrate in vivo activity, and identify the most potent candidates. Specific aim 2 is designed to determine the long-term tolerability and efficacy of the lead candidates in suppressing HBV gene expression and replication in the HBV transgenic mice. In specific aim 3 the antiviral efficacy of the leads and the potential for emergence of drug resistance will be tested in the context of a bonefide HBV infection initiated with a monoclonal viral isolate using human hepatocyte repopulated chimeric mice. Finally, in specific aim 4 we will determine the leads antiviral efficacy against infection with patient sera containing isolates of different HBV genotypes and sera from patients that experienced virological breakthrough on antiviral therapy. Together, these studies will be instrumental in introducing antisense based therapy as a novel approach to combat chronic HBV infection.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 350 million people throughout the world are chronically infected by HBV, 15-25% of whom will die from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. The work described in this proposal will exploit current and novel in vivo model systems to discover improved, safe and effective antiviral drugs to alleviate the human suffering and socioeconomic burden of this threat to public health.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV is primarily transmitted by heterosexual contact and approximately equal numbers of men and women are infected with the virus worldwide. Numerous studies to define the biology of HIV transmission have been undertaken with the goal of identifying stages in the processes from mucosal virus transmission through dissemination to distal lymphoid tissues that can be interrupted by vaccination. To large extent this effort has focused on understanding transmission of HIV to women with little effort define the transmission and dissemination in men exposed to HIV by insertive penile intercourse. We recently developed a reliable model of penile HIV transmission using SIV inoculation of mature male rhesus macaques. This model recapitulates the key virologic and epidemiologic features of HIV transmission in men, i.e. transmission is most efficient in to males when the inoculum is placed into the foreskin rather than simply onto the glans and shaft of the penis; and a single viral variant is found in plasma immediately after transmission (Keele, Miller Unpublished and see Preliminary Studies). We have characterized the virology and immunology of vaginally transmitted SIVmac251 in rhesus monkeys and in this application we propose to conduct parallel studies of penile SIV transmission. The studies will lead to a better understanding of how the HIV is transmitted to males by penile intercourse and the range of antiviral effector mechanisms that are present in the penile mucosal surfaces that are the sites of virus transmission. This information is required to rationally design vaccines to elicit immune responses in the male genital tract that can limit or prevent HIV transmission  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Men are regularly infected by penile HIV transmission and the foreskin seems to be a critical target tissue, because uncircumcised men are at higher risk for HIV infection. Despite this, almost nothing is known about the biology of penile HIV transmission. By defining the virology and immunology of SIV in the male genital we will be provide the biologic basis for attempting to elicit immune responses in these tissues by vaccines.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to assess the feasibility of using recombinant virus-like- particles (VLPs) to elicit neutralizing antibodies andprime CD4+ T cells reactive with hepatitis B viral (HBV) antigens as candidate immunotherapeutics for chronic HBV infection. For this purpose, we have defined 8 neutralizing B cell epitopes from the HBV envelope Pre-S1 region, which will be consolidated and inserted onto a species variant of the HBV core protein, namely the woodchuck hepatitis core antigen(WHcAg). Pre-S1 B cell epitopes were chosen because of their preferential expression on HBV virions. The WHO estimates that more than 360 million individuals are chronically infected with HBV and approximately 20- 40% will develop serious complication such as cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although a safe and efficacious preventative vaccine for HBV has been available for over 20years, HBV infections continue (with more than 50 million HBV infections per year) to be a major health problem and no effective treatments for chronic infection exist. Antiviral drugs have improved the therapeutic options for chronic HBV, but, their efficacy remains limited due to reactivation of HBV replicationupon drug withdrawal. Vaccine-based immunotherapy has been suggested as a possible monotherapy or as a combination therapy with antiviral drugs. However, immune tolerance has prevented therapeutic vaccine efficacy. To circumvent the obstacle of immune tolerance in HBV chronic carriers, we have chosen the WHcAg, which is approximately 66-68% homologous with the HBcAg, as a vaccine carrier. The WHcAg and the HBcAg are not crossreactive at the B cell level and, just as importantly for our purposes, are only partially crossreactive at the CD4+ T cel level. Therefore, CD4+ T cells specific for WHcAg-unique T cell sites will provide cognate T-B cell help for anti- PreS1 antibody production and will not be curtailed by immune tolerance. In fact, in preliminary studies in HBcAg-Tg mice, which are tolerant to HBcAg, immunization with hybrid WHcAg- PreS1 VLPs elicits equivalent high titer anti- PreS1 antibodies in wildtype and HBcAg-Tg mice. Specifically, in Aim 1 we propose to consolidate 8 HBsAg-PreS1 neutralizing B cell epitopes onto the WHcAg VLP carrier and optimize the constructs based on assembly, yield, stability and immunogenicity and the therapeutic efficacy of the VLP-based vaccine candidates will be evaluated in a transgenic (Tg) mouse model of HBV replication. In Aim 2 preclinical development of the WHcAg-PreS1 vaccine will be pursued including cGMP manufacturing and pharm/tox studies.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated by the WHO that worldwide more than 400 million people are chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and approximately 20-40% will develop serious complications such as cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although a safe and effective preventative vaccine for HBV is available, the existing treatments for chronic infection are unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. This is a proposal to develop virus-like- particles (VLPs) capable of eliciting neutralizing anti-HBV antibodies and priming CD4+/CD8+ T cells reactive with HBV antigens as a candidate therapeutic vaccine for chronic HBV infection.',\n",
       " 'Acute respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children, elderly and in immunocompromised patients, as well as of asthma exacerbations. No effective treatment or vaccine for RSV is currently available, and many fundamental questions regarding the pathogenesis of RSV-induced lung disease have yet to be answered. In the past project period, we pioneered work demonstrating the importance of oxidative injury in the pathogenesis of RSV infection, and the possible use of antioxidant intervention for this infection. Our new data provide novel mechanistic evidence in support of these findings, as we show that RSV infection results in downregulation of antioxidant enzyme (AOE) gene expression in human airway epithelial cells (hAECs), in mouse lung, and in children with bronchiolitis. Nuclear levels of NF- E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which regulates basal and inducible expression of AOE genes, are significantty decreased in response to RSV infection both in hAECs and in mouse lungs, while expression/activity of AOE negative transcriptional regulators is increased in response to RSV infection. The central hypothesis for our next grant period is that ROS production, along with the inhibition of cytoprotective AOE expression due to decreased Nrf2-dependent gene transcription, leads to clinical manifestations of RSV infection. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that antagonism between positive and negative transcriptional regulators determines the level of AOE gene expression in the context of viral infection. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that increased antioxidant cellular defenses decrease ROS production, oxidative stress and lung disease in response to RSV infection. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that decreased AOE gene expression is associated with greater severity of illness in infants with naturally acquired RSV infection. This project is synergistic with all the other projects of this Program Project, as it will include experiments linked to the fundamental scientific questions asked in PI. P3 and P4. related to the role of ROS-dependent activation of NF-KB (PI), formation of 8-oxo- guanine. which triggers novel GTPase-dependent cellular signaling (P3). and ROS-dependent signaling in response to allergen stimulation (P4). Completion of our studies will provide critical new information elucidating an important and novel molecular pathway by which respiratory viruses induce lung inflammation, with strong implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies ifor lower respiratory tract infections and virus-triggered precipitation of asthma attacks. RELEVANCE (See instructions); Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of bronchiolitis, pneumonia and flu-like syndromes, as well as asthma attacks, and so represents a substantial public health problem for the community. This project seeks to provide a greatly needed understanding of the molecular mechanisms that cause lung injury in RSV lower respiratory tract infections. Our results should lead to new pharmacologic strategies to prevent or treat these serious infections, thereby reducing RSV-associated morbidity and mortality.',\n",
       " \"Wildlife diseases are a recognized conservation threat and public health concern, yet there is remarkably little information on how diseases spread through wildlife populations. In this study, microbial genetics and network analysis are integrated to assess routes of (I) intraspecific pathogen transmission in reticulated giraffe, and (II) interspecific transmission between wild and domestic herbivores (black rhinoceros, Grevy's zebra, giraffe, impala, buffalo, and cattle) in Kenya. Our understanding of the dynamics of pathogen transmission is limited because it is difficult to assess who transmitted to whom. This project uses Escherichia coli as a proxy for pathogen transmission. Transmission between two individuals can be inferred if they share genetically similar subtypes of E. coli.  Inferred transmission will be used to construct a transmission network for wildlife and livestock in Kenya. The first component of this project investigates how the spatial and social organization of the giraffe population influences transmission dynamics. The second component quantifies the extent and directionality of interspecific transmission and identifies species that contribute disproportionately to pathogen spread, termed  super-spreaders.  Two of the species included in this study, the Grevy?s zebra and black rhinoceros, are endangered and vulnerable to disease-related population declines, which gives this study immediate conservation relevance.       Broader impacts. Although not usually pathogenic, E. coli transmission routes demonstrate where contact is sufficient for transmission to occur. Knowledge of these routes can be incorporated into disease control strategies. Targeted vaccination of super-spreaders is theoretically more effective at limiting disease than conventional vaccination strategies, but there are no existing methods to identify super-spreaders in wild populations. A major outcome of this project will be to develop new tools for identifying super-spreaders and tracing transmission routes in wildlife. This is a novel approach and will be broadly applicable in improving our ability to predict the impacts of disease.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We aim to prospectively define how specific genetic, biologic, and immunologic characteristics, along with environmental exposures, interact in children who experience severe RSV bronchiolitis early in life impact the subsequent development of asthma, airway hyperreactivity and allergy. Specifically, we will utilize a well- established cohort of children with severe RSV bronchiolitis that has been prospectively followed since 1998 (RSV Bronchiolitis in Early Life, RBEL-I, n=206), a retrospectively identified cohort of children with severe RSV bronchiolitis (Boston RSV Bronchiolitis cohort, n=200), and test our key findings from RBEL-I in a newly enrolled prospective cohort of infants with severe RSV bronchiolitis (RBEL-II, n=200). These cohorts will be the largest to date, with over 600 children with severe RSV bronchiolitis, and will enable us to test new hypotheses on the causation of asthma and allergic disorders early in life. We will be able to evaluate and confirm over 1500 polymorphisms in candidate genes associated with asthma, airway hyperreactivity, allergic sensitization and RSV susceptibility in three separate populations. We now propose to prospectively test the validity of the newly developed RSV-Asthma Predictive Index (RAPI) in this cohort as well as potentially modify this index to improve its predictive value. We will prospectively evaluate our findings of a dysregulated immune system associated with the development of asthma post-RSV bronchiolitis in RBEL-II. In concert with understanding the biologic and immunologic response of the host during and after severe RSV bronchiolitis, we are now proposing a powerful study of candidate genes associated with susceptibility to RSV and the development of asthma, airway hyperreactivity and allergic sensitization in the combined RBEL and Boston cohorts with over 600 children as well as their parent(s). Given the careful characterization of these children early in life, we will now be able to study potential gene-gene and gene-environment interactions leading to the development of different wheezing phenotypes in childhood. Our overall hypothesis is that children who experience severe RSV bronchiolitis in the context of the appropriate genetic predisposition, have a dysfunctional immune response that predisposes them to develop airway hyperreactivity and asthma. Accordingly, we propose to: Aim I: Evaluate prospectively the validity of a RSV-Asthma Predictive Index (RAPI) on the development of asthma and persistent wheezing following severe RSV bronchiolitis. Aim II: Evaluate prospectively the impact of a dysregulated immune system, specifically dendritic and regulatory T cells, on the development of asthma, persistent wheezing and allergic sensitization following severe RSV bronchiolitis. Aim III: Examine the relationships of ~1500 polymorphisms in genes associated with asthma, atopy, inflammation with the development of asthma, airway hyperreactivity, and allergic sensitization following severe RSV bronchiolitis.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We aim to prospectively define how specific genetic, biologic, and immunologic characteristics, along with environmental exposures, interact in children who experience severe RSV bronchiolitis early in life on the subsequent development of asthma, airway hyperreactivity and allergy. This study will be the largest to date, consisting of over 600 children with severe RSV bronchiolitis, and will enable us to test new hypotheses on the causation of asthma and allergic disorders early in life.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the primary functions of skeletal muscle is to generate force. Physiological and biomechanical experiments have demonstrated that actin-myosin interaction is responsible for force generation. In order to make movements and perform locomotion, force generated by the activation of muscle fibers has to be transmitted to bony skeleton of the body though tendon. A first step of the force transmission process is to allow force to cross the cellular membrane of the muscle cell. Two pathways have been identified for force transmission: longitudinal (myotendinous), and lateral (myofascial) pathways. Transmitting forces from myofibrils to the tendon laterally involves several anatomical structures, including the myofibrils, the extracellular matrix (ECM), and the lateral linkages between myofibrils and the ECM. Despite some observational evidence for the existence of the lateral transmission of force, the exact mechanisms of lateral transmission and how age-related changes in the structural and mechanical properties of the muscle, tendon and ECM affect it are not well understood. Age-related (young vs. old) structural changes are well document and include changes in collagen content, organization, cross-links, fiber diameter, and the thickness of the ECM. We hypothesize that these age-related changes in the structural properties of the ECM will directly effect the mechanical properties and more important, the lateral transmission of force, and thus be a significant mechanism associated with aging-muscle disability syndromes. The objective of this study is to test this hypothesis by examining the effect of aging on the structure and function of the ECM, and to determine how these changes affect the lateral transmission of force. We will experimentally measure the effect of aging (young vs. old) on the structural and mechanical properties of the ECM of skeletal muscle of the rats. Experiments will be performed to assess the effect of aging on lateral transmission of force. A mathematical mechanical model will be used to determine the mechanisms of role of lateral transmission of force, and the role of ECM. To validate the model, we will compare the results from the experimental measurement and model. Parametric studies using the model will be performed to assess factors that will affect lateral transmission of force, including the structural and mechanical properties of the muscle fibers and the ECM, as well as the interactions between the muscle fibers and the ECM. Successful completion of this proposal will provide new clinical information for the treatment, rehabilitation and training strategies for the elderly, individual's with muscular dystrophy, muscle trauma, and injury and disease associated with ECM abnormities, such as polymyositis and sclerosis  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this study is to examine the effect of aging on the structure and function of the ECM, and to determine how these changes affect the lateral transmission of force.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With an estimated 2.6 million new HIV infections in 2009, the world remains a long way from reaching the ambitious UNAIDS goal of zero new infections. In this context, prevention of HIV-1 transmission has been identified as a top Fiscal Year 2012 Trans-NIH AIDS Research Priority. In the wake of recent observational and randomized trial evidence that treatment provided to HIV-positive individuals can reduce transmission of the virus to their sex partners by as much as 96%, there is an urgent need for a new paradigm that redefines our understanding of transmission potential as it relates simultaneously to both sexual risk behavior and ART exposure. For HIV-positive women, who can now anticipate prolonged survival in the context of lifelong treatment, this will require an understanding of how transmission potential varies across the lifespan in relation to key reproductive health events including decisions about contraception, fertility desire, pregnancy, the post partum period, and menopause (hereafter, lifecourse events). Our objective in this multidisciplinary series of quantitative and qualitative studies is to characterize the presence, magnitude, and contextual basis of variations in HIV-positive Kenyan women's transmission potential in relation to these important lifecourse events. A prospective cohort design with collection of complementary behavioral and biological endpoints will provide strong evidence regarding the presence and temporal sequence of associations between lifecourse events and transmission potential, defined as unprotected sex in the setting of late ART refills. The open cohort study will include 360 HIV-positive Kenyan women who are offered ART in Mombasa and Nairobi. Participants will be recruited to represent three distinct and important risk groups; women in discordant couples, pregnant and post-partum women from maternal and child health clinics, and female sex workers. This diversity will provide substantial generalizability, as well s an opportunity to identify important differences in transmission potential between the three risk groups. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions will add to our understanding of the sociobehavioral context for changes in behavior. Our ability to leverage ongoing data collection from a cohort of HIV-positive women in Mombasa provides a unique advantage, as this will allow us to evaluate changes in transmission potential over more than 10 years in a subset of the study population. These studies will provide the most comprehensive data available to understand transmission potential in HIV-positive African women treated with ART. This research will directly improve public health, expanding our understanding of HIV prevention from a perspective that recognizes the potentially profound influence of HIV-positive women's reproductive lifecourse events on their transmission potential. These data are expected guide program implementation and inform development of a new generation of clinical trials to optimize prevention in an era where effective use of ART will take its place alongside condoms and abstinence as a cornerstone of prevention in positives.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This multidisciplinary study of HIV-positive Kenyan women will employ a rapidly evolving paradigm for understanding HIV transmission potential by employing simultaneous measurement of sexual risk behavior and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Changes in transmission potential will be evaluated in terms of their relationship to women's key reproductive choices and events including contraception, fertility desire, pregnancy, the post-partum period, and menopause. These data will inform HIV prevention research and program implementation in the context of overwhelming recent evidence that antiretroviral therapy should be recognized alongside condoms and abstinence as a cornerstone of prevention in positives.\",\n",
       " 'This competitive renewal will build upon our previous work on the role of chemokines and their receptors inairway inflammation. Children that had experienced severe responses to RSV infections often progress intodeveloping long-term pulmonary problems. In addition to pediatric populations, recent evidence has indicatedthat there is an unknown and relatively unexplored relationship to pulmonary disease in adult populations,including those with asthma and COPD. This renewal application will focus on the role of specific chemokinereceptors and their ligands in RSV infection as well as the effects of RSV on exacerbation of cockroachallergen induced disease. Our hypothesis for this proposal is that RSV infection causes airways disease viathe activation of CD8+ T cell responses dependent upon CCR1-mediated mechanisms, whereas resolution ofdisease relies upon the activation of CxCR3-mediated mechanisms. We have designed experiments using 3specific aims to test our hypothesis and to identify the mechanisms of disease progression. These specific aimsinclude: I. To determine what role CCR1+ T lymphocytes have on RSV-induced disease and in exacerbationof allergic airway disease; II. To establish the mechanism of CxCR3+ and its ligands in the immune responseleading to the resolution of RSV-induced disease, and III. To identify the differential role of chemokines forDC subset, pDC vs. cDC, trafficking to the lungs and activation leading to altered pulmonary responses. Ourstudies will examine both a primary RSV-induced response as well as RSV-induced exacerbation of allergicairway disease. Determining the mechanisms that drive the early responses to RSV and mediate or alleviatesevere disease will offer an excellent opportunity to target the early manifestations that have long-termdetrimental effects in children, and possibly aid in attenuating progression into severe pulmonary disease. Ourmodels have now been well characterized and allow our studies to address the cell populations involved andthe relevant mechanisms that drive the detrimental responses. We will extend our hypothesis to include thatCCR1+ CD8 T cells are a significant source of Th2 cytokines, especially IL-13, that lead to exacerbatedallergic airway disease. The mechanism of the recruitment of CCR1+ CD8 T cells will center on the inducedexpression of CCR1 ligands, especially CCL5, within the airways of RSV-infected hosts. We have now alsoprovided novel data that has identified that CxCR3-mediated mechanisms induce a critical anti-viral responsevia recruitment and activation of important innate cells especially plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The use ofcellular transfer experiments with specific animals deficient in targeted molecules will enhance our ability todefine the particular cellular mechanisms in vivo during a complex immune response. These mechanisms maybe similar to those that are involved in infants, where RSV-infected children often progress into having longtermpulmonary problems and in asthmatics for exacerbated disease.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of severe lower respiratory tract illness in infants and the elderly. There is no approved vaccine despite decades of effort. Early attempts to develop a formalin- inactivated vaccine (FI-RSV) resulted in disease enhancement following environmental exposure to RSV. Efforts to develop recombinant subunit vaccines have met with limited success due to poor immunogenicity and short-lived responses. Over the last few years, several avenues of study have suggested that the adverse inflammatory responses associated with RSV infection, and perhaps the failure of the FI-RSV vaccine, are linked to the RSV-G protein which plays a critical role in virus attachment to target cells. RSV-G contains a CX3C chemokine motif that interacts with the CX3CR1 chemokine receptor and appears to elicit an inflammatory Th2-biased immune response that contributes to disease pathogenesis. We have shown that antibody responses to the CX3C motif can reduce virus infectivity, inhibit RSV-G chemokine-modulating activity and reduce lung inflammation following infection. Vaccine designs that elicit an IFN response may also help to reduce the Th2-biased response and lung inflammation associated with RSV infection. In this Phase I project, we will use an innovative approach to produce synthetic nanoparticle vaccines carrying the RSV-G peptide coupled with RSV T-cell target antigens that favor IFN responses. Nanoparticles will be fabricated using layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of oppositely charged polypeptides, including designed peptides (DP) carrying the antigen payload, to build ultrathin films on solid nano-sized cores. We have shown that vaccines made by this strategy improve the immunogenicity of both T-cell and antibody target epitopes without triggering adverse inflammatory reactions. The current proposal will (1) identify the optimal DP designs for increasing loading and stability of nanoparticles, (2) select LbL nanoparticle vaccine designs based on potency and phenotype of antibody and T-cell responses induced (with particular emphasis on IFN responses that have been shown to improve protection from RSV disease), and (3) test the biological activity of antibody responses in assays measuring virus and chemokine neutralization, inhibition of chemotaxis, and protection of mice from viral burden and lung inflammation following challenge with RSV. The RSV-G DP will include a CD4 T-cell epitope that overlaps the chemokine motif, and will be complemented by addition of T-cell target epitopes from RSV-M2 or RSV-F to provide additional IFN modulation of the Th1/Th2 balance. Thus, the novel nanoparticle vaccines produced in this study will have the capacity to elicit multiple mechanisms of protection against RSV infection and aberrant lung inflammation. The deliverable of this project is one or more LbL RSV-G vaccine candidates with demonstrated safety and efficacy in animal models; these candidates will be further developed in a subsequent Phase II project that will complete the steps necessary for Investigational New Drug application filing and eventual clinical testing. The application of this innovative approach to RSV vaccine development will also impact vaccine development for other infectious diseases.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to use mathematical modeling to better understand the emergence/re-emergence of dengue fever and similar mosquito-borne diseases and to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies on stopping them. The long term goal of this proposal is to reduce the burden of dengue fever and similar diseases by characterizing transmission to inform models of and response efforts to outbreaks. We intend to deliver a product to these public health officials and policy makers which not only is accurate and predictive, but which utilizes data that is readily available and/or routinely collected (e.g. clinical data, and that from mosquito surveillance programs), as well as a model that is both accessible in use and produces understandable and interpretable outputs. Further, we anticipate our model and outputs to be expandable to other existing vector borne viruses as well as to newly emerging threats not yet identified. Currently existing mathematical models of dengue virus transmission, though add to our understanding of transmission dynamics, are not primarily designed to account for detailed epidemiological prediction and evaluation. Predictive models need to span multiple scales, from house to the community to the international level. Accordingly, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Develop mathematical models of the infection dynamics of DENV in the mosquito and human, 2) Formulate models of the contact dynamics that drive transmission of DENV and 3) Integrate these component models into detailed agent-based simulation models of mosquito-borne transmission. By addressing these aims, we will confront the urgent public health problem of the emergence/re-emergence of dengue and similar viruses, such as chikungunya virus, in the continental US.  RELEVANCE: As no vaccine or treatment is available for dengue virus, mitigating transmission is the first and only line of defense of public health. Adding precision and thus accuracy to known and accepted measures of transmission and ultimately informing a transmission model will allow for quicker, more directed and actionable responses to prevent and/or respond to an outbreak of a vector-borne virus such as dengue.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. They are often referred to collectively as a high-risk group, but this generalization belies the fact that there is a high degree of heterogeneity of HIV risk within the population. Certain socio-ecological factors place some MSM at higher risk for HIV. There are a number of potential drivers of the HIV epidemic, including substance use, undiagnosed infections and high number of sexual partners. However, these broad categories need refinement in order to identify transmission patterns, as it remains unclear which drivers are contributing to the epidemic with HIV transmission as the biological outcome. Real-time identification of epidemiological hot spots, pinpointing the chains of viral transmission and biologically linking drivers of the epidemic are needed to effectively target prevention strategies and interrupt these chains of HIV transmission. Increasing use of antiretroviral (ARV) resistance testing in response to revised clinical guidelines has enriched theavailability of viral sequences to study HIV transmission epidemiology. DNA sequencing can be used to establish epidemiological linkages between infected persons. Such linkages are referred to as HIV transmission clusters, comprised of cases whose viruses share sufficient phylogenetic similarities to suggest a recent common source of infection or participation in linked chains of transmission. Identifying clusters that account for the largest proportion of onward transmissions and characterizing the structural, behavioral and biological correlates that predict transmissibility would inform the development of targeted interventions. The proposed study will use a combination of biological, epidemiological, behavioral and psychosocial research tools to obtain an innovative perspective on the HIV epidemic among MSM. The specific aims are: 1) to characterize HIV transmission clusters and correlates associated with transmission; 2) to evaluate the relative impact of acute, recent and long-term HIV infections on transmission clusters; and 3) to assess HIV transmission cluster patterns in relation to attempted risk reduction strategies. We are poised to analyze viral sequences to elucidate the key patterns of HIV transmission. We will enhance the utility of existing data by creating a population-based, analytical database that will harmonize an urban area's HIV/AIDS case registry with viral resistance and sexually transmitted diseases databases. Qualitative interviews will be conducted to describe the psychosocial and behavioral contexts at the level of the transmission cluster to complement the phylogenetic data. Using an adapted Social Ecological model as a conceptual framework, the interviews will elicit seroconversion narratives and obtain detailed data on any specific strategies attempted to prevent HIV transmission. Real-time analysis of HIV transmission cluster data will place us on the leading edge of the epidemic and enable assessment of how high-risk clusters and current prevention strategies affect transmission patterns.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The continuing transmission of HIV among MSM calls for maximizing the use of the rich bio-epidemiological data on hand. The proposed HIV transmission cluster analysis will integrate laboratory data with behavioral data to follow key transmission patterns in order to inform tailored development of interventions to interrupt the chains of transmission.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the primary vector for dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya. The vector is present in most urban communities stretching along the U.S.-Mexico border yet dengue transmission has only been noted in two U.S. border communities in Texas, notably Brownsville and Laredo, TX. While many argue that this is a result of different social factors across the border, this fails to explain the lack of transmission in some communities in northern Mexico, notably Nogales, Sonora. Nogales is a large urban area on the Mexican side of the border with large vector populations and a constant influx of people from dengue endemic areas yet no local cases have been recorded. Vector presence alone is not sufficient to cause disease transmission; vectors must also survive long enough to blood feed and become infected, have the parasite develop and feed again, transmitting the virus. Climatic influences on the lifespan and behavior of Ae. aegypti may also influence the risk of dengue transmission in this region which lies at the boundary of both virus and vector. Geographic areas such as this, at the edge of the range of disease and vector, are at greatest risk of emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases. We will assess the relative age structure of Ae. aegypti populations in nine cities with varying climates in the southern United States and Sonora, MX by trapping and molecularly determining the ages of adult Ae. aegypti during four mosquito seasons. We expect that cities with extremely dry and hot conditions will have younger Ae. aegypti populations. Cities with reported dengue transmission we expect to have Ae. aegypti that are on average younger when taking their first blood meal than cities without transmission. To determine how the age of Ae. aegypti population vary over a finer spatial scale, we will sample adults in 150 households in Hermosillo, Mexico; a city with a history of dengue outbreaks. Additionally, we will survey the households for potential social and environmental factors that mediate the relationship between climate and longevity. We expect to find significant variability across households. Residences with older mosquitoes will have more vegetation, fewer barriers to mosquito access and indoor resting sites, no competing vector species and no control measures. From the information gathered in the first two objectives, we will construct a model to predict the likelihood of the expansion of Ae. aegypti populations that survive long enough to transmit dengue and thus changes in risk of dengue transmission. We expect that models of risk of dengue under climate change scenarios will decrease in areas that surpass a heat and dryness threshold and will increase in populations with increasing moisture.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will advance understanding related to the impact of climate change on the possible emergence of dengue in the southern United States and northern Mexico. A key outcome will be a broader understanding of how climatic changes would impact the longevity of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a critical component of disease transmission. Risk maps will be generated that depict changes in density of vector's capable of transmission and length of mosquito season.\",\n",
       " \"The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a twenty-four-month research fellowship by Dr. Elizabeth Nichols to work with Prof. Kenneth Wilson at Lancaster University, Lancaster UK. Biotic interactions between parasitic and free-living taxa are fundamental to a range of ecosystem processes, including the mediation of parasitic disease transmission between species in a community. Parasites with complex life-cycles (e.g. helminthes (parasitic worms)) exert enormous fitness and economic costs on humans and livestock across the global tropics. However how environmental change affects the biotic interactions involved in parasite transmission remains poorly understood. The proposed project seeks to develop a novel dung beetle - fecal helminth model system to tease apart the mechanisms by which land-use change influences parasitic disease transmission, by impacting interactions between free-living species and parasitic helminths. As many dung beetles species broadly use the feces of different mammal species, beetle communities in tropical agricultural landscapes commonly interact with fecal helminths (parasitic worms) of two distinct transmission strategies: the fecal-oral helminths of wild and domestic herbivores, and the trophically transmitted helminths of wild and domestic carnivores (when they eat the adult beetles). Preliminary data indicates that dung beetle feces processing often decreases the rate of successful transmission for fecal-oral helminths, yet increases the transmission of trophic transmissions helminths, for which beetles commonly act as intermediate hosts. These strikingly different outcomes suggest that land-use changes that alter dung beetle community diversity may simultaneously suppress and maintain or amplify disease transmission across different mammal host species. In addition, the magnitude and direction of these effects may be predicted by a small set of dung beetle species' traits.  This project combines field, experimental and modeling approaches to characterize the mechanistic relationships between dung beetle community regulation of parasite transmission, and the impacts of land-use change on transmission dynamics.At a basic level, the research will (1) enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying transmission dynamics and their response to land-use change, and (2) contribute to the development of a novel model system that can expands upon extant single-microparasite transmission models to assess how multiple complex life-cycle parasite species respond changes in free-living species diversity. The economic and health impacts of helminths (parasitic worms) in tropical agricultural landscapes are tremendous. At an applied level, this work will provide useful information on how environmental change in agricultural areas influences those species interactions tightly linked to ecosystem service outcomes, such as reduced disease transmission. In addition to these benefits, this research will help develop new international collaboration between the PI and research groups at Lancaster University, Lancaster UK, the Federal University of Lavras, Lavras Brazil, the University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, Barnard College, New York, USA, and the American Museum of Natural History, New York, USA.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Local, site-specific characteristics largely control the transmission dynamics of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Arboviruses, in turn, adapt to local conditions, maximizing their potential to perpetuate and emerge as health threats. The adaptive potential of arboviruses is driven by error-prone replication, which creates a geneticallydiverse pool of competing virus genotypes within each host. This application examines the influence of three important characteristics of any given transmission focus on viral genetic diversity; and how genetic diversity influences host-virus interactions. Our previous research has allowed us to make very clear predictions about each of the three examined characteristics. The frequency of contact between mosquitoes and vertebrates varies in time and space. Aim 1 will determine how the frequency of this contact influences the genetic diversity of West Nile virus (WNV) using a laboratory model transmission cycle. We predict that shorter incubation in mosquitoes allows maintenance of viral genetic diversity and high fitness. A second critical characteristic of a transmission focus is the mosquito species involved in virus transmission. Aim 2 will therefore assess how important vector mosquitoes differ in their ability to respond to WNV infection through RNA interference (RNAi) and thus drive virus diversification. Field-collected and colonized Culex (main) and Aedes (secondary) mosquitoes will be assessed. We predict that significant variation in RNAi activation will be detected within and between mosquito species, and that this variation will be associated with virus genetic diversity and altered vectorcompetence. A third critical characteristic of a WNV transmission focus is the bird species involved in virus amplification. Aim 3, accordingly, will evaluate how crows, sparrows and robins shape WNV populations. Virus will be passed in each of these birds and genetic diversity and fitness assessed. We will also use these birds to measure the replicative fitness of different existing WNV strains and populations. We predict that wild birds exert strong purifying selection on WNV populations and that genetic diversity of the virus contributes little to its fitness in birs, but that bird infection may select for novel WNV genotypes. The significance of this work is that it will provide novel data the mechanisms that underpin the emergence of RNA viruses as health threats. The proposed research is conceptually innovative because it links the ecology of WNV transmission foci with virus adaptive plasticity. It is technically innovative because it uses uniqe methods for measuring virus fitness among relevant hosts in vivo and through its use of deep sequencing. Ultimately we seek to define the conditions that favor the emergence of novel virus genotypes.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This renewal aims to assess mechanisms that control WNV genetic diversity in the context of natural transmission cycles. Specifically, these studies will show how the intensity of transmission in a given focus influences the emergence of novel viral genotypes, and how important mosquitoes and birds differ in their propensity to drive virus evolution. Proposed studies are focused on WNV which is a significant and still- emerging health threat in the US, but will provide important data on how flaviviruses interact with their hosts to persist in nature and emerge as health problems.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in children and infants, affecting an estimated 64 million people and causing 160,000 deaths worldwide per year (WHO). Each year in the United States, ~100,000 infants and ~170,000 adults are hospitalized due to RSV infection. High-risk adults (elderly and patients with chronic heart or lung disease) experience the highest RSV-attributed mortality in the US (~14,000 deaths/year), similar to the rates of seasonal influenza. The annual cost of RSV on the US healthcare system is ~$2 billion. Currently, no vaccines or disease-specific therapeutics are available to combat RSV, and treatment is mostly limited to supportive care. For the most acute cases, ribavirin, a broad-range antiviral with questionable efficacy and significant safety issues can be used, though it is not indicated for adults. Only onepreventative is available, Synagis (Palivizumab), a monoclonal antibody that inhibits RSV infection, but its use is limited to high-risk infants. Synagis is very expensive (~$5000 for a course of therapy) and reduces RSV-related hospitalizations of high-risk infants by only 55%. There is an urgent need for new anti-RSV prophylactics and therapies that can be applied to a broad patient population. In this project we will apply an innovative strategy to identify novel, protease-resistant D-peptide drug candidates for the critically underserved RSV patient population. Our drug discovery platform employs an enantiomeric screening technology (mirror-image phage display) coupled with protein design, to identify D- peptides that stop the virus as itattempts to enter a cell. We have successfully validated this platform technology by identifying a promising anti-HIV preclinical candidate, which is the most specific and potent D- peptide inhibitor known. Our anti-HIV D-peptide targets a conserved pocket found on a region of the HIV envelope protein, the N-trimer, which is transiently exposed during viral entry. It inhibits all maor circulating HIV-1 strains and, by design, possesses an extremely high barrier to resistance. RSV uses a highly similar mechanism of viral entry, and an analogous vulnerable pocket on the N-trimer has been identified on the RSV viral surface. This pocket will be the target for our discovery efforts. In this two-year Phase I SBIR, we propose to identify and structurally characterize 1st generation D-peptide RSV entry inhibitors. In Phase II we will rapidly apply all of the optimization techniques used in our HIV discovery efforts, which improved the potency of our HIV-specific drug by over six orders of magnitude and gave it an extraordinary resistance barrier. Once we have fully optimized the potency, specificity and resistance profile of our D-peptide RSV entry inhibitor, we will explore its utility as an anti-RSV therapeutic and preventative.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection causes hospitalization of an estimated 270,000 infants and high-risk adults in the US each year, leading to $2 billion in medical costs. No therapies exist to treat infected patients, and the only availabe preventative therapy is very expensive, modestly effective, and limited to use in high-risk infants. Navigen Pharmaceuticals is developing a potent and novel inhibitor of RSV infection, which, if successful, will address the considerable unmet need for new anti-RSV prophylactics and therapies that can be applied to a broad patient population.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We believe that eradication of malaria is achievable but not without a potent vaccine that interrupt malaria transmission (VIMT) transmission blocking vaccine. A logical and promising strategy is to combine target antigens from multiple stages to potently prevent transmission. To prevent transmission a vaccine should target the pre-erythrocytic (sporozoite and liver stages) and the sexual-mosquito stages of the life cycle. An ideal malaria vaccine would prevent infection, disease, and transmission by targeting at a minimum the pre- erythrocytic (sporozoites and liver stages) and optimally other stages of the parasite life cycle also. Pre- erythrocytic stage vaccine development is based on the observation that immunization via bites of irradiated mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites (SPZ) provides high-level protection. The circumsporozoite protein (CSP) was discovered by immunizing mice with irradiated SPZ. A higher percent of volunteers immunized with radiation attenuated PfSPZ have T cells that recognize Pf cell-traversal protein for ookinetes and sporozoites (PfCelTOS) than PfCSP, and immunization of mice with PfCelTOS protects against challenge with rodent malaria SPZ at the pre-erythrocytic stage. We have discovered that antibodies induced in mice by immunizing with recombinant (r) PfCelTOS with adjuvant inhibited Pf development to oocysts in mosquitoes in vivo and PfSPZ invasion and development in hepatocytes in vitro. When mice were immunized with rPfCelTOS alone, rPfCSP alone, or both, mice immunized with both proteins had higher Abs against PfSPZ and activity in blocking SPZ invasion and development in hepatocytes (86%) than did mice immunized with either protein individually. The observations that antibodies against rPfCelTOS, had biological activity against parasite mosquito (ookinete) and pre-erythrocytic (SPZ) stages, and were additive or synergistic with anti-PfCSP antibodies against SPZ are unique, and argue for further development of this protein. To further enhance VIMT effects, we will assess Pf von Willebrand factor A domain-related protein (PfWARP), a highly conserved, soluble ookinete specific protein that we have shown previously to potently inhibit development of oocysts in the mosquito midgut. Our aim in this study is to develop a combined multiple stage vaccine to potently prevent transmission by inhibition of oocyst development. PfCelTOS and PfCSP are also expressed in hemocoel stage sporozoites and thus our strategy would also target the conversion of oocysts to infectious sporozoites in the salivary glands. We will study the three proteins as immunogens alone and in combination, aiming to induce 100% transmission blocking activity. We believe that eradication of malaria is achievable but not without a potent transmission blocking vaccine, and that these 3 proteins can achieve this goal. Such a vaccine would be used in infants, young children, adolescent females (prevent malaria in pregnancy) and malaria elimination campaigns as a public health measure; an enormous global health market.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria causes 400-500 million clinical cases and >1 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel. We believe that eradication of malaria is achievable but not without a potent transmission blocking vaccine. A logical and promising strategy is to combine multiple stage targets to potently prevent transmission. Such a vaccine would have huge public-sector markets. In public sector markets it would be used in infants, young children, adolescent females (prevent malaria in pregnancy) and malaria elimination campaigns as a public health measure.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the most common cause of hospital admission for children, and in the elderly population RSV is the second most common cause of death from respiratory infection after influenza virus. Most studies of RSV infection on the cellular level have been performed in cultured, immortalized cells. In these cells, RSV binds to heparan sulfate (HS), a complex oligosaccharide on the cell surface, as its primary receptor to initiate infection. In primary, well differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, an excellent model for the airway cells that RSV targets, RSV infects only ciliated cells and only via the apical surface. But this surface has no detectable HS. RSV must, therefore, use a different receptor to enter these cells. The goals of this project are to identify that receptor and the site on the RSV attachment protein that binds to it. Both will provide novel targets for the development of novel antiviral agents against RSV.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important respiratory pathogen for infants, and behind only influenza virus for the elderly. Much of what we know about the replication of RSV comes from studying the virus in immortalized cells. But it now appears that the first step in RSV infection, attachment to the target cell, is completely different in airway cells. This project will explore RSV infection of primary cells that closely model the airway epithelium, from both the virus and cell perspective.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many important biological determinants of HIV-1 disease progression and transmission map to the envelope glycoprotein, including antibody neutralization susceptibility, viral tropism for entry and epitopes for T cell response. Genetic and phenotypic characterizations of the envelope gene suggest a bottleneck effect in the spread of the virus to other body compartments and transmission, resulting in a predominantly homogenous viral population. However, the limitations in current methods to accurately assign HIV-1 coreceptor usage, distinguish genetic variations and detect minor variants in the HIV quasispecies within a patient and between transmission pairs have led to controversial findings. Furthermore, the small patient sample size studied has been too small to make broad generalization regarding mechanisms of HIV transmission and pathogensis. Lastly, these various properties of the envelope gene have been studied predominantly in subtype B infection and less clearly elucidated in HIV-1 subtype C, the most rapidly spreading and prevalent infection worldwide. We hypothesize that a heterogenous HIV-1 population with different envelope sequences and coreceptor usage are transmitted during infection but is not fully characterized and measured by our current available techniques. We propose to use novel and more sensitive methods to determine coreceptor usage and to perform in-depth sequencing and genetic analyses of the envelope gene from a large subtype C clinical cohort from Botswana. The envelope gene in subtype C infection will be studied in longitudinal samples, as well as between plasma-breast milk and mother-infant pairs. We plan to study in greater depth the properties of the HIV-1 subtype C envelope glycoprotein with the following specific aims: 1) identify clinical and genetic determinants of coreceptor switching, 2) assess for correlates of breastfeeding transmission of HIV-1 and 3) examine pattern of viral transmission among mother-to-child transmitting pairs occurring through different routes of MTCT using ultradeep sequencing. The results of this study will further the understanding of viral evolution in the context of transmission and disease progression, identify clinical correlates of transmission and disease progression, and ultimately give insights into potential strategies of prevention, treatment and vaccine development in those parts of the world most affected by HIV.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms of HIV pathogenesis, transmission and clinical progression will have public health relevance by guiding the design of HIV prevention and treatment strategies.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT:Patients with familial surfactant protein-C (SP-C) deficiency develop a progressive interstitial lung disease(ILD) with considerable morbidity, mortality and no effective therapy. Respiratory exacerbation in SP-Cdeficient patients has been associated with viral infections including Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)indicating that viral infection is a contributing factor to disease. This application is based upon preliminarydata demonstrating a novel role for SP-C in innate protection of the lung from viral infection. SP-C deficientmice (Sftpc -/-) have been generated in order to determine the role of SP-C in pulmonary homeostasis.Sftpc -/- mice develop an ILD like disease and are highly susceptible to RSV lung infection with decreasedviral clearance and robust and sustained pulmonary inflammation. The increased severity of RSV infectionin the Sftpc -/- mice and the impact of viral infection in SP-C deficient patients indicate that SP-C is asignificant component of the innate immune system of the lung. A role for SP-C in innate defense issupported by preliminary data showing that SP-C inhibits signaling through toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). Thisapplication will determine the role of SP-C in protecting the lung from RSV and will test the centralhypothesis that SP-C reduces RSV infectivity and RSV induced inflammation. In aim1 mechanisms will beidentified whereby SP-C reduces viral titers. Experiments will determine if SP-C impedes viral uptake, altersphagocytosis or binds to RSV proteins that mediate attachment and cell entry. In aim2 mechanisms will bedefined whereby SP-C reduces RSV induced inflammation. Experiments will test whether SP-C modulatesTLR3 activity by regulating TLR3 association and internalization or by regulating intracellular TLR3 signalingevents. The site of SP-C and TLR3 interaction and structural motifs on SP-C that regulate TLR3 function willbe determined using site specific mutagenesis of SP-C. Aim3 will identify the pulmonary responses to RSVregulated by SP-C. SP-C will be conditionally expressed in the lungs of Sftpc -/- mice and exogenous SP-Cwill be delivered to Sftpc -/- mice during infection to establish parameters for correction of RSV inducedinjury. The proposed studies will identify mechanisms whereby SP-C protects the lung from RSV injury.Data from the translational experiments of aim 3 will be useful in designing therapy for exacerbations inSP-C deficient patients.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Education and microbicides active against HIV represent the best approaches to controlling the epidemic worldwide in the absence of a protective vaccine. Our research program studies the earliest events in genital tract transmission. We have identified a protein expressed by genital tract epithelial cells that could serve as a potential target for inhibition of transmission of HIV called gp-340. We have demonstrated that gp-340 is expressed on the cell surface of vaginal and cervical epithelial cells, in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo and binds HIV envelope. Of significance to genital tract transmission, gp-340 binding of virus leads to an increase in both the infectivity and half-life of the virus. Gp-340 expressed by genital tract tissue and cell lines also mediates transcytosis of HIV, the vesicular transport of macromolecules from one side of a cell to the other. A second molecule called syndecan has been studied and shown to have similar trans-infection and transcytosis properties and is also expressed by genital tract cells. We have identified a peptide inhibitor of envelope binding to gp-340 that blocks both gp-340 mediated trans-infection and transcytosis in in vitro and ex vivo models of genital tract transmission. This peptide contains a portion of a motif that inhibits syndecan mediated transinfection, as well, and we will modify this peptide to inhibit envelope binding to both macaque gp340 and syndecan and develop it into a microbicide. This potential role of gp-340 and syndecan to act at a stage of infection after delivery to the lumen of the genital tract but prior to interaction with and infection of target cells is very attractive and novel in microbicide design. We hypothesize that interfering with this process will inhibit or block genital tract transmission. In the initial R21 portion of this proposal, we will establish in vitro macaque systems of genital tract transmission. If we demonstrate that macaque gp340 and syndecan mediate trans- infection and transcytosis and V3 loop derived peptides or improved versions block macaque gp340 and syndecan mediated transinfection and transcytosis, we will proceed with the R33 portion of the grant. The specific aims of this are: microbicide development with in vitro testing and to test the effect of blocking gp340 and syndecan-HIV Env interaction on genital tract SIV transmission in the rhesus macaque vaginal transmission model. Through these specific aims, we will develop a new type of microbicide and determine the role of genital tract gp-340 and syndecan in HIV transmission. If successful, these studies will deliver a new microbicide based on host cell interactions with HIV that promote genital tract transmission to preclinical trial studies.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective prevention strategies for HIV are critically needed, and an effective HIV vaccine is the best long-range hope to dramatically reduce the rate of new HIV infections. To this goal, our current understanding of the biology and epidemiology of HIV transmission remains limited. This Program Project will focus on the identification and systematic evaluation of individuals who have been recently infected with HIV and the sexual partners who transmitted HIV to them (Transmission Pairs) to elucidate and quantify epidemiologic, behavioral, biologic, virologic, and host factors that contribute to transmission.  The San Diego Primary Infection research group has a long and successful history of recruiting acutely and very recently HIV-infected individuals and their transmitting partners. With new approaches to expand our identification of such study participants, as described in the Clinical and Specimen Core, we will address in Project 1 (Transmission Probability): (Aim 1) the transmission probability per contact ((J), (Aim 2) the rate of partner change (c), (Aim 3) the duration of infectious stages (D), and thus determine the reproductive number (R0) of HIV in this population. These investigations will be complemented with Project 2 (Transmission Correlates) that will identify and quantify the contributions of important biologic (Aim 1), viral (Aim 2), and host (Aim 3) correlates of HIV sexual transmission. Most importantly, this research will allow for the accurate estimation of a potential prevention strategy or candidate vaccine's anticipated efficacy based on both an estimation of the target populations' ongoing risk behavior and a thorough understanding of viral and host factors that contribute to HIV transmission. The Administrative Core (Core A) will play a central role in coordinating the administrative, fiscal, data, and statistical support for this Project as well as providing scientific support and facilitating synergistic interaction among investigators and collaborators critical to the success of the interactive projects. The Clinical and Specimen Core (Core B) will identify, recruit and enroll study subjects and collect, process, store, and manage the clinical specimens needed to meet the objectives of the two proposed research projects.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women bear the greatest burden of new HIV infections throughout the world. Nevertheless, our understanding of the biology underlying HIV transmission and pathogenesis in women is incomplete. The overarching goal of this PO1 proposal is to unite a dynamic research team with complementary expertise that bridges HIV molecular biology, reproductive biology, immunology, and clinical and epidemiological research to address important, unanswered questions. 1) What sites in the female reproductive tract are most involved in HIV transmission? 2) What HIV properties and host factors critically affect transmission rates? 3) How do endogenous or exogenous sex hormones impact transmission frequency and do these factors modulate innate and adaptive immune responses in the female reproductive tract that counter infection? 4) Why have all tested vaginal microbicides not only failed to stop but often caused paradoxical increases in HIV infection? 5) Can the safety of new microbicide candidates be better assessed before large scale clinical testing? We hypothesize that 1) the upper female reproductive tract represents a highly permissive but understudied portal for HIV infection, 2) specific viral (Env) and host (semen peptides) factors importantly influence the success of male-to-female HIV transmission, 3) changes in sex hormone levels (progestin-only contraception) enhance HIV transmission and menopause adversely modulates both mucosal and systemic innate and adaptive immune responses to HIV, and 4) ineffective and unsafe microbicides activate common patterns of gene expression in the upper female reproductive tract, creating a cellular milieu that favors HIV transmission. Identification of these genes will permit construction of a predictive genetic signature for  microbicide harm.  These hypotheses will be tested in three specific aims involving extensive cross-project collaborations. Specific Aim 1: To study viral and host factors regulating male-to-female transmission of HIV in the female upper genital tract (Warner Greene, MD, PhD); Specific Aim 2: To explore the upper female reproductive tract as a portal of HIV transmission and to assess effects of sex steroids and microbicides on these tissues (Linda Giudice, MD, PhD, and Karen Smith-McCune, MD, PhD, and Specific Aim 3: To investigate immunopathogenesis of HIV in the female reproductive tract (Barbara Shacklett, PhD). These studies will be enabled by two essential cores, the Clinical and Data Core (Ruth Greenblatt, MD) and the Administrative Core (Drs. Greene and Greenblatt). RELEVANCE: Together, these studies promise to greatly extend our understanding of the molecular, cellular, and immunological basis for HIV transmission and pathogenesis in women. This work could also propel future efforts aimed at developing effective biomedical approaches to interdict male-to-female transmission of HIV.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis B (HBV) coinfection in HIV is common in resource-limited settings and is a leading cause of mortality. Infant immunoprophylaxis to prevent perinatal HBV transmission is often unavailable in resource- limited settings endemic for HIV and HBV, including those in Africa. As in HIV, antiviral therapy can be effective in the prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) of HBV. However, there are potentially unintended consequences of single agent antiviral drug exposure for PMTCT. In HIV, when single agent nevirapine is used for PMTCT, HIV resistance commonly occurs and is associated with HIV treatment failure in infants and mothers. Similarly, the use of single agent lamivudine, an antiviral with both HIV and HBV activity, results in high rates of HBV resistance and a vaccine escape phenotype. Despite the widespread use of lamivudine in WHO-recommended HIV PMTCT regimens in areas endemic for HBV, it is unknown how lamivudine will impact HBV perinatal transmission and HBV drug resistance in HIV coinfection. The long-term goal of this research program is to identify the optimal prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) regimen in HIV/HBV coinfected pregnant women. The objective here is to determine how lamivudine-containing PMTCT regimens impact HBV transmission. The central hypothesis is that lamivudine will reduce HBV perinatal transmission but result in maternal and infant HBV drug resistance and HBV vaccine escape mutations. Maternal minor populations of drug resistance may also be important in the transmission of resistance. The rationale is that if HBV drug resistance is common after lamivudine- containing PMTCT therapies, then regimens with higher HBV potency will be required. This central hypothesis will be tested using the serum repository of HPTN 046, an HIV PMTCT trial of extended infant nevirapine prophylaxis in 1522 mother-infant pairs in Africa. We will pursue three specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of lamivudine in the prevention of HBV perinatal transmission in HIV/HBV coinfected pregnant women, 2) Identify the predictors of perinatal HBV transmission and 3) Determine the impact of lamivudine on maternal and infant HBV drug resistance and vaccine escape phenotypes. Under the first two aims, the incidence and predictors of perinatal HBV transmission in HIV coinfection, including the role of antepartum lamivudine, will be determined. Under the third aim, the impact of lamivudine exposure on maternal and infant drug resistance will be examined. Using a novel minority variant assay developed by the applicant, the role of HBV minority variants as predictors of transmission will also be examined. The approach is innovative because it will change how HBV PMTCT regimens are selected and because it will utilize a novel minority variant detection assay that has several advantages over currently available techniques. The proposed research is significant because it will be the first step in defining the optimal PMTCT regimen in HIV/HBV coinfected women. Ultimately, such knowledge will inform global HBV public health prevention strategies.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health, as it will inform global strategies in the prevention of HBV perinatal transmission, applicable to both HIV coinfection and HBV monoinfection. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission, particularly to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS), which has identified viral hepatitis an emerging critical research priority.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With improved financial and technical supports, many malaria endemic nations are once again considering a goal of malaria elimination. However, this ambitious goal is met with tremendous technical difficulties especially in regions where Plasmodium vivax is prevalent. Interruption of malaria transmission worldwide has been recognized as one of the greatest challenges in malaria elimination. Vaccines that interrupt malaria transmission are ideally suited to this task. However, the progress in development of transmission blocking vaccines (TBVs) has been very slow. To date, we only have a few TBV immunogens with compelling evidence of transmission blocking activities. For P. vivax, TBV studies lag even behind and only two post-fertilization antigens Pvs25 and Pvs28 have been studied. Therefore, this application targets the serious deficiency of knowledge about pre-fertilization stage antigens in the neglected P. vivax parasite using systematic approaches including antigen discovery in rodent malaria parasites, validation of transmission blocking activities in P. vivax, and development of novel vaccine delivery tools. We aim to 1) identify new sexual stage antigens and evaluate their transmission blocking potentials in the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei; 2) validate known pre-fertilization TBV candidates and newly identified candidates using fresh P. vivax clinical isolates; and 3) improve transmission blocking activities of antigens by expressing the antigens in a baculovirus surface display system and by using a TBV combination strategy targeting both pre- and post-fertilization antigens simultaneously. Results from these comprehensive studies will contribute to increased knowledge about TBV development, which is urgently needed for the ultimate elimination of vivax malaria.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to use the rodent malaria parasite as a model for initial screening of new transmission blocking vaccine candidates, which will be further validated in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax. Identification and evaluation of transmission blocking vaccines against vivax malaria parasite are urgently needed for the impending malaria elimination campaigns.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV in the acidic cervicovaginal fluids of infected women is likely coated by anti-Env antibodies. Since HIV is sexually transmitted, these antibodies do not always prevent infection in the recipient partner and therefore may be of insufficient quantity or quality to neutralize virus in vivo. But could the antibodies that coat HI in genital tract secretions facilitate mucosal transmission? This question will be addressed with a rhesus macaque model of penile SIV exposure. We will test the hypothesis that antibody facilitates lentivirus transmission across genital tract mucosa. The hypothesis is based on our finding of marked enhancement of transcytosis of HIV immune complexes due to pH-dependent engagement of epithelial cell Fc neonatal receptors (FcRn). In addition, transmitted/founder (T/F) strains of HIV tend to bind better to antibodies and to be more susceptible to neutralizationthan are strains isolated late in infection, raising the possibility that antibody selects strains or successful transmission across mucosal surfaces. We will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of pH and low concentrations of antibody on transmission efficiency following penile exposure of rhesus macaques to SIV. An established penile exposure model will be modified to test the effects of anti-Env antibody, at concentrations similar to thosefound in female genital tract secretions, on penile SIV transmission; and 2) Delineate the role of antibody in selecting T/F strains of SIV following penile exposure. The number of T/F strains and their env sequences, from animals infected with antibody-coated and with uncoated virus, will be compared. In addition, pseudoviruses will be constructed to determine if T/F Env pseudoviruses can be phenotypically distinguished from non-T/F Env pseudoviruses in antibody/pH-dependent transcytosis assays. We believe this research will define a completely novel mechanism of sexual transmission of lentiviruses, generating critical data on early events in infection that will shift current paradigms and inform vaccine development. Specifically, if immune-complexed virus behaves differently than naked virus with respect to mucosal transmission across male genital tissue, current animal challenge models, which, to our knowledge, exclusively utilize naked virus, would require re-evaluation. Additionally, antibody responses generated by vaccination would need to successfully compete with donor antibody bound to virus and be of sufficient quantity and quality to avoid the potential of facilitating transmission. Finally, this research may suggest novel prevention strategies targeting FcRn-mediated transcytosis.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research focuses on sexual transmission of HIV, a problem of huge public health concern. We propose a novel mechanism by which transmission might occur, and our investigations might lead to new strategies to prevent infection.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexual transmission of HIV is relatively inefficient. Most sexual exposures do not lead to transmission. Of the swarms of virus in the semen, only a single virion is usually transmitted. In SIV transmission to female macaques, which is the basis for current models of HIV transmission to women, infection propagates in a small focus of genital tissue CD4 T cells. In the first week, SIV is restricted to the genital mucosa where the virus amplifies before systemic dissemination, providing a window of opportunity where intervention could inhibit transmission. This proposal will explore HIV transmission in 2  human  models - polarized human cervical explants and humanized mice transplanted with fetal human hematopoietic stem cells, liver and thymus ( BLT mice ). Our first aim is to characterize the cell types, phenotype and tissue distribution of infiltrating hematopoietic cells in normal human cervix and compare it with the distribution of human cells in the BLT model. This will provide important information about how closely the genital mucosa of BLT mice resembles humans. The second aim is to characterize HIV infection in cervical explant cultures and in BLT mice infected intravaginally to identify the first infected cells and understand how the infection amplifies and spreads in the tissue. In addition we will characterize the changes in immune cell activation and induction of cytokines, interferons and chemokines that occur in both models following HIV infection. These changes are hypothesized to enhance HIV susceptibility of resident cells in the mucosa and promote recruitment of additional susceptible cells. HIV infection of macrophages and T cells does not trigger cytosolic innate immune nucleic acid sensors to induce Type I interferons. HIV evasion of these sensors is mediated by the Trex1 DNase, which digests failed reverse transcripts. The lack of efficient HIV replication in dendriticcells also effectively suppresses interferon production by most dendritic cell subsets. The main source of Type I interferons in chronic HIV infection, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, are not normally found in the uninflamed genital mucosa. Our underlying hypothesis for aim 3 is that the lack of an immediate interferon response allows HIV to gain a foothold in the tissue. We hypothesize that knocking down TREX1 in CD4+ cells in the genital tract will trigger an IFN response to HIV in infected T cells that will suppress the local burst of viral replication. Howeve, early IFN induction might also enhance inflammation and recruitment of immune cells to the genital mucosa that could have an opposite effect. Therefore in vivo studies are needed to decipher the effect of interferons at the point of transmission. In aim 3, interferon levels will b manipulated around the time of intravaginal HIV exposure by treatment with exogenous interferon?, knockdown of TREX1 and other genes involved in interferon expression, and antibodies that neutralize interferon activity. We will focus on analyzing the effect of local TypeI interferon induction on HIV replication, the activation status of CD4 T cells in the genital mucosa, the recruitment of immune cells to the tissue and the expression of cytokines and chemokines and chemokine receptors that regulate immune cell ingress and egress from the tissue.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Further development of human models of sexual transmission of HIV will help to improve our understanding of HIV transmission, which will inform efforts to design vaccines and topical vaginal microbicides to prevent the continuing spread of the HIV epidemic. In particular we will determine whether the presence of IFNs at the point of transmission inhibits transmission; if IFN induction during exposure inhibits transmission, host factors that inhibit IFN induction, such as Trex1, might be selected for targeting by conventional small molecule drugs, biologics or small RNAs. An additional benefit of this study will be to show how gene knockdown could be used in humanized mice to interrogate the role of individual genes in vivo to study HIV transmission or more generally to investigate the role of individual genes in chronic HIV infection or other human immune diseases, much as gene knockout has been used so effectively in mice.',\n",
       " 'Alterations in dopamine transmission occur during drug abuse and addiction. To understand these changes, it is necessary lo first understand the basic physiology that underlies dopamine transmission. The aim of this Pathway to Independence Award (K9WR(K)) proposal is to investigate the mechanisms of dopamine transmission while providing the candidate (Dr Christopher Ford) with the necessary mentored training in electrophysiological and electrochemical techniques. The applicant has completed the K99 mentored phase of the award and has secured an independent tenure tract Assistant Professor position in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the Case Western Reserve University School (¿f Medicine. Having completed 2 of the three aims of the original research proposal and having met his initial career goal of becoming an independent investigator studying the cellular and molecular basis of addiction, this current pha.se of the proposal (R(X)) is designed to provide independent support that will I K used to further his studies, complete the remaining aims of the award and gain long-lemi ROI grant support. The central aim of this proposal is to determine the relationship between extracellular dopamine and i(s physiological consequences. The objective during the mentored phase will be to determine the mechanisms regulating dopamine transmission. The hypothesis to be tested is that dopamine mediates transmission in the VTA in a tightly regulated, synaptic manner. The objective during the independent phase will be to define the concentration and duration of dopamine mediating transmission. The hypothesis being that transient, high concentrations of dopamine mediate transmission. A lack of knowledge of the basic mechanisms of dopamine transmission has hindered progress towards determining how transmission becomes dysregulated during the course of drug addiction. Thus this work has the potential to identify and direct new strategies to treat drug abuse and addiction.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-negative individuals in stable heterosexual relationships with HIV- positive individuals face a very high risk of HIV infection. Among those couples who want to have children, promoting abstinence and condoms may not be viable or acceptable options for reducing sexual HIV transmission risk. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) dramatically reduces the risk of sexual and perinatal HIV transmission. Recent exciting successes with vaginal microbicides and the promise of antiretroviral pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may offer additional protection against sexual transmission of HIV while allowing for conception. Understanding trends and predictors of fertility intentions, periconception behaviors, and pregnancy among HIV-affected couples is a critical step towards designing novel bio-behavioral reproductive counseling interventions to reduce sexual HIV transmission risk in the context of desired conception. Objectives We will examine the prevalence and predictors of fertility desire and reproductive behavior, and the incidence of pregnancy among HIV-positive women and men on ART who report HIV-negative partners. We will also explore attitudes towards biologic interventions to reduce sexual transmission during conception. Aims We aim to (1) Analyze longitudinal trends and predictors of fertility desire and behavior among ART- treated women and men with HIV-negative partners by key biological, behavioral, social, and structural predictors; (2) Measure incidence of pregnancy and livebirth among a) women on ART with HIV-negative partners and b) HIV-negative partners of men on ART; and (3) Explore acceptability of biologic interventions (microbicides, PrEP) for reducing sexual HIV risk while enabling conception among discordant couples. Methods We propose to add a Reproductive Health survey and pregnancy-testing module to the ongoing NIH-funded Ugandan Antiretroviral Treatment Outcomes (UARTO) cohort of 1000 ART-treated individuals in Mbarara, Uganda. Participants will complete an annual interview to assess fertility intentions, reproductive behaviors, and pregnancy. Women will also undergo quarterly -hcg urine testing; male participants will be asked to report incident pregnancies among sexual partner(s). Log-linear and survival analysis methods (with a generalized estimating equation extension) will be used to model predictors of the primary outcomes. Our work will be grounded in an ART-specific conceptual model of fertility change (adapted from Bongaarts' proximate determinants of fertility). Innovation With the advent of novel biologic strategies to reduce sexual HIV transmission, it is paramount to understand how these interventions apply to serodiscordant couples who desire children. This work will lay the foundation for the design of integrated bio-behavioral reproductive health interventions to reduce HIV transmission rates between serodiscordant partners and their infants.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-negative individuals in stable heterosexual relationships with HIV-positive individuals face a very high risk of acquiring HIV. Promoting condoms and abstinence does not account for fertility desires, which are common among HIV-affected men and women. We aim to understand attitudes towards bio-behavioral strategies to reduce periconception HIV transmission risk as well as trends and predictors of fertility desire, behaviors, and pregnancy among HIV-affected couples in Uganda as a first step towards designing interventions to reduce sexual transmission of HIV in the setting of desired conception.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together new data from Montreal and new theory from Michigan to generate a new understanding of how HIV spreads, of how spreading patterns alter the effects of control programs, and of how genetic analyses can be used to predict control results in any particular population. The Montreal data shows a high rate of clustering in HIV genetic sequences from early infection but little clustering from late infection. The clusters represent active transmission chains that might be detected and interrupted. The Michigan theory shows that risk behavior fluctuations interact strongly with high PHI transmission to affect transmission dynamics, the pattern of clustering, and the effects of HIV transmission control programs. The pattern of HIV clustering should therefore help predict transmission control program effects. We will define effective HIV control programs that balance efforts to detect and interrupt active transmission foci with efforts to decrease transmission through earlier treatment. That balance will differ when transmission is diffuse and constant or when it is punctuated by mini-epidemics of transmission during primary infection. The high rate of early diagnosis and virus sequence analysis in Montreal gives us the most refined view to date of the spatial-temporal dynamics of infection. The model analyses we now propose will greatly refine that view and clarify what effects different control strategies will have under different conditions. Our preliminary results show that behavioral risk fluctuations change expected intervention effects from both therapy and from interrupting active transmission chains. Fortunately, these effects are reflected by genetic sequence patterns. Accordingly we pursue 3 Aims. Aim 1 maps control program effects across a broad range of contact patterns, population structures, risk behaviors, and natural history of infection variants. Aim 2 maps transmission tree patterns on to that same space. This will allow interpretation of genetic patterns from anywhere where such patterns might be gathered. Aim 3 adapts models specifically to Montreal by fitting model parameter values in a two stage estimation process. The first stage fits deterministic compartmental models to HIV surveillance and special study data using an MCMC process. The second stage refines the parameter space estimated in the first stage by fitting genetic sequences on to transmission trees generated by a stochastic process model that has been shown on average to exactly reproduce the deterministic model results. In this refined parameter space the methods of Aim 2 indicate the consequences of various alternatives in HIV control program design.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Powerful new data are uniquely available from Montreal on how HIV transmissions during early infection are genetically, spatially, and temporally clustered. These will be analyzed using new theory developed at Michigan to determine how infection is flowing through a population and how early HIV Rx and traditional Public Health STD control actions can stop that flow. The new insights and analysis methods developed should help all control programs everywhere set more effective control priorities.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT: To develop strategies to block parenteral transmission of HIV, it is critical to understand the mechanisms that initiate HIV infection and viral spread in vivo. Though for 25 years, the field has largely focused on cell-free mechanisms of viral spread to model and understand the disease, a compelling case can be made for the spread of HIV through direct contact between infected and uninfected cells. Our recent studies have focused on the cell biology of intercellular adhesive structures, called virological synapses, that enhance viral spread between cells. Using an innovative strategy to visualize viral transmission through synapses, we engineered a fluorescent, infectious molecular clone of HIV. At virological synapses, we uncovered dynamic movements of assembling virus particles in infected T cells, as well as a novel endocytic process that accompanies synapse formation and infection. The complexity of the cellular processes and their high efficiency suggests that this may be the dominant paradigm for HIV dissemination. We will test the hypothesis that the virological synapse represents the fundamental unit of transmission in vivo. Blocking the synapse, either with antibodies or with other antagonists, may be the key to breaking the cycle of transmission. For this avant garde project, we will exploit recently developed small humanized animal models to examine the sequence of events that occurs during parenteral HIV transmission. We will test the relative efficiency of cell-free versus cell-associated routes, and track viral dissemination in the first minutes and hours after viral challenge. To reveal the cell-cell and cell-virus interactions at an organismal level, we will employ in vivo imaging approaches to track the movement of infected or virus-carrying cells within humanized mice. We will reveal a sequence of interactions between infected cells/virus and uninfected cells. The results will provide new strategies to interfere with viral transmission and dissemination.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the critical importance of chemical synaptic transmission in normal and pathological neural activity, intensive investigation of the underlying mechanisms has long been and remains a primary focus in molecular and cellular neuroscience. Greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of synaptic transmission will be of tremendous value in defining neurological disease processes and developing rational therapies to combat them. The proposed studies build on our recent genetic analysis in Drosophila implicating the DISABLED (DAB) proteins in the synaptic vesicle endocytosis - the process which recycles neurotransmitter filled secretory vesicles after they fuse with the surface membrane and release their contents. In part because DABs are known to play critical roles in sorting surface membrane proteins and have been implicated in major human health conditions including cardiovascular disease, it is exciting to consider another role for these proteins and their molecular mechanisms in synaptic transmission. A function for DABs in sorting synaptic vesicle proteins has not been identified previously, however the proposed studies may now reveal an important synaptic connection for an already intensively studied set of DAB-dependent mechanisms. This project will (1) build on genetic analysis implicating a novel DAB-related mechanism in synaptic transmission to define the functional role of dDAB in the critical process of synaptic vesicle endocytosis and (2) examine the connections between a new function for DAB proteins and previously characterized mechanisms of synaptic vesicle endocytosis to gain a better understanding of the organization and molecular interactions underlying chemical synaptic transmission. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Given the critical importance of chemical synaptic transmission in normal and pathological neural activity, greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of synaptic transmission will be of tremendous value in defining neurological disease processes and developing rational therapies to combat them. The proposed studies are building on exciting discoveries through genetics that are implicating specific genes and proteins and promise to provide new insights into the process of chemical synaptic transmission.',\n",
       " \"Half or more of HIV transmission events may occur within the period of high infectivity (andoften high risk behavior) that can last 11 months or more after a person is initially infected.Unfortunately, neither test-and-treat intervention methods nor Acute HIV Infection projects havefound effective ways to intervene against transmission during this risky  recent infection  period. We seek to develop effective intervention techniques against HIV transmission among drugusers and their community members during the recent infection period using a combination ofdrug injection-, sexual- and social-network-based contact tracing methods; community alerts inthe networks and venues of recent infectees; and the logic of going  up  and  down  infectionchains. Our first Aim is to develop and evaluate ways to locate  seeds,  defined as drug usersand other people who have recently been infected. Our second Aim targets members of seeds'networks and people who attend their venues. We will test them for acute and for recentinfection, and alert them to the probability that their networks contain highly-infectious membersso they should reduce their risk and transmission behaviors for the next several months tominimize their chances of getting infected. This may also reduce transmission by untestedpeople with recent infection. Community, network and venue education about the need andvalue of supporting those with recent infection should reduce stigma. Our third Aim is to reduceHIV transmission and to develop new ways to evaluate  prevention for positives  generally aswell as our own success in reducing transmission. We will do this using a combination of follow-up interviews and testing, including of viral loads; phylogenetic techniques; and discrete eventsimulation modeling to assess our effectiveness.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Innate antiviral immunity comprises a host defense mechanism for restricting virus spread. The host cells recognizes invading viruses by specialized receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that can specifically identify pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG like helicase (RLH) receptors (e.g. RIGI and Mda5) are known to recognize virus specific PAMPs for induction of antiviral response mediated by activation of the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3). IRF3 activation results in production of antiviral cytokine interferon-a/¿ (IFN). Recently we identified nucleotide- binding oligomerization domain-2 (NOD2) protein, belonging to the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and leucine-rich-region (LRR) containing family (known as NLRs) of cytoplasmic receptors as a viral PRR. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated that NOD2 can trigger an antiviral response (via activation of IRF3/IFN) following infection with human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV possess single stranded RNA or ssRNA as its genome), the major etiological viral agent causing worldwide pulmonary infections among infants, children and elderly. Therefore the current proposal is aimed at - a) establishing NOD2 as a new viral PRR, b) studying the mechanism of NOD2 activation, c) identifying and characterizing the molecules that act downstream of activated NOD2, and d) investigating the in vivo role of NOD2 during RSV pathogenesis, RSV induced lung inflammation and development of lung disease. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that expression of NOD2 in RSV infected cells results in activation of IRF3/IFN. Further studies revealed that - a) NOD2 can recognize ssRNA to activate IRF3/IFN, and b) mitochondrial outer membrane residing protein IPS-1 (MAVS) may act downstream of NOD2 for activation of IRF3/IFN . Thus, we hypothesize that NOD2 is a new member of viral PRR that can recognize viral ssRNA genome to launch an antiviral response following activation of mitochondrial IPS-1 protein. The hypothesis will be tested by focusing on the following specific aims: Aim # 1. Study the role of NOD2 during antiviral response against RSV - The major question of this aim is - Does NOD2 constitute a viral PRR that can activate IRF3/IFN in infected cells? We will investigate whether NOD2 is involved in IRF3/IFN activation during RSV infection of normal primary human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells. The physiological relevance of NOD2 during host defense against RSV pathogenesis and RSV mediated lung inflammation/disease will also be established by using NOD2 knock-out (KO) mice. Aim # 2. Study the mechanism of NOD2 activation - The major question of this aim is - a) Does NOD2 recognizes ssRNA and interacts with mitochondrial localized IPS-1 to activate IRF3/IFN? This question will be addressed by - a) studying association of NOD2 with ssRNA (RSV genome and synthetic ssRNA) and IPS-1, b) examining NOD2 mediated IRF3/IFN activation in cells lacking IPS-1, and c) identifying the specific NOD2 domain(s) involved in ssRNA recognition and IPS-1 interaction.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects the respiratory tract to cause high mortality and morbidity among infants, children and elderly. Currently, no vaccine or antiviral therapy exists to counteract RSV infection. Our proposed research focused on elucidating the host defense mechanism against RSV infection will be important to understand RSV induced lung disease and viral pathogenesis. The knowledge derived from the proposed studies will be helpful in development of efficient antiviral therapeutics against RSV infection.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria transmission entails development of the Plasmodium parasite in the mosquito. We have identified a critical interaction between an unknown ookinete lectin-like protein and a chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan ligand on the mosquito midgut lumenal surface. We hypothesize that by disrupting this interaction through the use of small molecule inhibitors we can prevent parasite establishment in the mosquito and, subsequently, completely abrogate malaria transmission. This is a translational research grant proposal with the goal of taking our basic research understanding of Plasmodium-mosquito host interactions toward the development of novel highly potent malaria transmission-blocking therapeutics. Our first aim, the Complete molecular characterization of Plasmodium ookinete protein-midgut glycosaminoglycan interactions involves (1) identifying novel lectin-like ookinete molecules by glycan-affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, (2) characterizing their functional role in vivo through the production of gene knockout parasites, (3) assessing their binding affinity for mosquito chondroitin glycosaminoglycans by protein array-surface plasmon resonance, and (3) gaining insight into the structure-function of the molecule(s) in complex with chondroitin glycosaminoglycan fragments and structural analogues by molecular modeling and x-ray crystallography. The second aim of the project, the Development of lead Plasmodium transmission-blocking glycan-mimetic compounds and assessment of their transmission-blocking potential involves identification of novel derivatives and analogues of our lead transmission-blocking compound, VS1 (a non-peptidyl polyvinylsulfonated polymer), which is a structural mimic of midgut chondroitin glycosaminoglycans and inhibits >95% of parasite development in the mosquito. To develop more potent structural analogs, we propose a four-tiered approach: (1) isolation of varying chain-lengths of the VS1 polymer, (2) derivitization of VS1 to enhance inhibitory activity and bioavailability, (3) derivitization of (+)-usnic acid, a polyphenolic compound from lichens, and (4) assessment of the utility of peptide mimotopes of mosquito chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans as transmission-blocking vaccine targets. To help progress toward preclinical studies, the top candidate compounds from each approach will be analyzed for their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in animal and human serum models.  Mosquitoes transmit the Plasmodium parasite from infected human hosts to uninfected individuals. By blocking a critical protein-glycan (carbohydrate) interaction between the parasite and the mosquito vector through the use of small inhibitory compounds (drugs) we prevent parasite establishment in the mosquito and effectively disrupt the transmission cycle of the malaria parasite. This strategy is especially important given that many current antimalarials and vaccine candidates still permit transmission of the parasite through the mosquito, moreover, our lead compound has added potential utility as a multi-stage antimalarial therapeutic since it also prevents sporozoite establishment in liver cells, the first step towards the progression of disease in humans.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Persons with acute HIV infection (AHI) may be responsible for a substantial proportion of onward transmission of HIV infection, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. AHI, the period between infection and seroconversion, lasts up to 10-12 weeks. During this brief window of time, the virus replicates rapidly, leading to high concentrations of HIV RNA in blood and genital secretions. Consequently, the probability of transmission during unprotected intercourse is very high. Identifying persons with AHI and intervening to reduce onward transmission represents a tantalizing, but unproven, opportunity for HIV prevention. We propose an aggressive HIV transmission prevention program to identify persons with AHI and intervene behaviorally and biologically. Our central hypothesis is that persons with acute HIV infection play an important role in HIV transmission. We further hypothesize that behavioral and treatment interventions in acutely infected persons will reduce onward transmission. To address these hypotheses, we will conduct an exploratory study complemented by mathematical modeling to assess the potential impact of the proposed prevention program. The specific aims of our proposed study are to: 1) Develop a novel program to prevent HIV transmission by identifying and informing persons with acute HIV infection (AHI) in Lilongwe, Malawi, 2) Evaluate a short-term, combined behavioral and antiretroviral therapy (ART) intervention to prevent HIV transmission among persons with AHI, 3) Determine the potential individual and combined impact of each component of the intervention using mathematical modeling. To achieve these aims, we will use our well-established infrastructure in Lilongwe, Malawi. We will take advantage of new and existing technologies to identify people with AHI more rapidly. Immediately after diagnosis, persons will be randomized to standard counseling, an intensive behavioral intervention, or the behavioral intervention combined with short term antiretroviral therapy (ART). The behavioral intervention is based on the Information-Motivation- Behavioral Skills Model. The ART will use new and potent antiretroviral drugs to rapidly block HIV replication and limit infectiousness. Using the data collected in this pilot study, we will use rigorous mathematical modeling to assess the potential impact of the prevention program on the epidemic within a community and plan a large randomized trial. Persons with acute HIV infection (AHI), the earliest stage of HIV infection, may transmit HIV infection at a high rate, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Given this important possibility, we hypothesize that behavioral and treatment interventions in acutely infected persons will reduce their transmission. To address this hypothesis, we will conduct an exploratory study, coupled with mathematical modeling, to examine the potential impact of combining a behavioral intervention with a course of antiretroviral treatment in persons with AHI.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests partial support for an international meeting on Synaptic Transmission as part of the Gordon Research Conference series to be held at the Waterville Valley Resort in the mountains of New Hampshire during the week of July 29-August 3, 2012. The broad and long term goal of the conference is to increase our understanding of the fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms of synaptic transmission. The synapse serves as the basic signaling unit of the nervous system. Synaptic transmission underlies every aspect of brain function and is relevant to most neurological diseases, as well as mental illness and drug addiction. The specific aims of this meeting will be to convene 34 speakers that represent critical areas of synaptic transmission research with a total of 150 participants for a five day conference in a relatively isolated setting. The program will have two keynote lectures and eight sessions that broadly address current issues in the nano-scale structure and molecular machinery of synapses, the regulation of synaptic transmission by calcium, trans-synaptic signaling and postsynaptic modifications. A session devoted to ribbon-type synapses in the eye and ear will highlight structural and functional diversity of synapses. Another session is devoted to the synaptic basis of brain disorders and a meeting will conclude with an integrative session on the role of synapses in circuits. In addition, two evening poster sessions will permit all participants to contribute to these topics. The significance of this application is that the Gordon Research Conference on Synaptic Transmission is a critical component of the yearly series of conferences that propel research in the international community of synaptologists. The health relatedness of this application is that the discussions will define the questions that require experimental resolution of a wide range of devastating brain disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, drug addiction, mood disorders, loss of peripheral sensory function and many others, which are collectively emerging as synapto-pathies.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ubiquitin signaling system, which promotes regulated protein degradation, is essential for synapse development and synaptic transmission. Hundreds of enzymes exist that have the ability to add or remove ubiquitin polypeptides from proteins. Less is known about the functions and relevant substrates of these enzymes in neurons and at synapses. The long-term goal is to determine how ubiquitin enzymes regulate synaptic transmission. Given that ubiquitin system dysfunction is linked to neurological and neurodegenerative diseases in which aberrant synaptic transmission occurs, such information may lead to the identification of drug targets to aid in treating these conditions. Recent work established that the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC), an ubiquitin ligase that controls protein abundance in the cell cycle, also regulates neuronal development and glutamatergic synaptic transmission; yet much remains unknown regarding its mechanism of action and relevant substrates at these or other synapses. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which the APC regulates synaptic transmission in vivo. This will be done using the model nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, which shares significant conservation of nervous system proteins and function with humans. Preliminary experiments indicate that, in addition to regulating glutamatergic synapses, the APC negatively regulates transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a tripartite synapse in C. elegans where contraction of postsynaptic muscle is controlled by a balance of inputs from excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABAergic motorneurons. The APC may act in any or all of these cell types to impact the amount of muscle activity. Additional preliminary localization studies and behavioral assays led to the central hypothesis that the APC acts in presynaptic motorneurons to promote ubiquitination and degradation of NMJ proteins important for increasing muscle excitation. In Aim 1, cell type-specific loss of function and rescue experiments, behavioral assays, and quantitative imaging will be used to determine the site and mechanism of APC action during NMJ signaling. Additional preliminary data led to the identification of one potential APC substrate at the NMJ, the G protein-coupled receptor, FSHR-1. In Aim 2, genetic and behavioral analyses, along with imaging and biochemistry, will be employed to characterize the role of FSHR-1 at the NMJ and the relationship between FSHR-1 and the APC. In Aim 3, RNA interference will be used to identify additional APC substrates. This research will provide new insight into how the balance of excitatory to inhibitory transmission is regulated-a balance lost i human seizure syndromes, such as epilepsy. These studies also will contribute to the global picture of how ubiquitin signaling impacts synaptic transmission, which is critical for learning an memory. Given that ubiquitin system misregulation occurs in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's Diseases, and mutations in ubiquitin enzymes are linked to several neurogenetic disorders, elucidating how the APC and its substrates control synaptic transmission may facilitate the development of relevant therapeutics.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves determining the molecular mechanism by which the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC), an ubiquitin ligase enzyme, regulates synaptic transmission in vivo. Proper signaling at neuronal synapses is required for learning and memory and underlies all nervous system function. Misregulation of synaptic transmission and ubiquitin system dysfunction occur in many neurological disorders. Thus, a more complete understanding of the mechanism of action and relevant substrates of the APC ubiquitin ligase will contribute critical information to the global picture of synaptic transmission and ubiquitin enzyme activity.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent reports show that young-adult binge drinking has become a major public health problem. Nevertheless, the neurochemistry associated with this type of alcohol misuse has not been extensively studied. Previous radiotracer imaging studies in alcohol dependence have reliably shown that this disorder is associated with a reduction in dopamine type 2/3 (D2/3) receptor binding in addition to a decrease in dopamine transmission of the ventral striatum. Studies in alcohol-preferring rodents show similar results. In addition, functional MRI studies have shown that alcohol dependence is associated with a loss of reward-related activation in the ventral striatum. The goal of this study is to measure these parameters of dopamine transmission in young- adult binge drinkers compared to control subjects. Using PET radioligand imaging, we will measure both D2/3 receptor binding in addition to changes in extracellular dopamine in response to a psychostimulant challenge. We will also image, for the first time in human subjects, the kappa receptor in vivo. Previous pre-clinical studies suggest that alcohol exposure is associated with an increase in endogenous dynorphin and a downregualtion of the kappa receptor. All subjects will also undergo an fMRI using the monetary incentive delay task, a task that is associated with decreased ventral striatal activation in alcohol dependence. We will also investigate the correlation between dopamine transmission measured with PET and activation measured with fMRI in the ventral striatum in the same subjects. In addition, this application will explore the correlations between the brain measures obtained, including the correlation between pre-synaptic dopamine function measured with PET and fMRI and the association between kappa receptor availability and dopamine transmission. It has previously been hypothesized that the decrease in dopamine transmission see in alcohol dependence is associated with a  reward deficiency syndrome . A possible mechanism for this is dynorphin signaling at the kappa receptor. Thus, in this study, we have proposed a set of specific aims that are designed to measure dopamine transmission and reward-related activation with the hypothesis that disruptions in striatal dopamine transmission underlie excessive alcohol consumption in this vulnerable population.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Previous studies have shown deficiencies in the brain neurotransmitter dopamine in alcohol dependence. This decrease in dopamine transmission is thought to play an important role in disruptions in normal reward processing. The goal of the present study is to investigate whether these alterations are present in young-adult binge drinkers, and to investigate potential mechanisms behind the disruptions in dopamine transmission.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), the first tumor virus identified, has been the genesis for seminal discoveries in cancer biology and retrovirology, including oncogenes, reverse transcription, and fundamental aspects of retrovirus assembly. In our laboratory, we utilize RSV as a model system for dissecting mechanisms that regulate nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of proteins and RNAs during the process of retrovirus assembly. Recently we discovered that the RSV Gag protein, which orchestrates virus assembly from the plasma membrane, unexpectedly shuttles through the nucleus. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrated that RSV Gag selects its viral RNA genome in the nucleus, suggesting a novel paradigm for retroviral RNA packaging. Furthermore, our results suggest that the decision regarding whether the unspliced RSV RNA will be packaged into a virion or used to synthesize structural viral proteins is made in the nucleus. However, host pathways that influence the cytoplasmic destiny of RSV unspliced RNAs remain poorly understood. A further challenge is to decipher how RSV circumvents cellular mechanisms that block export of intron-containing pre-mRNAs, which are normally prevented from leaving the nucleus as part of the  quality control  machinery that regulates gene expression. Many of the mechanisms that regulate nuclear RNA export are dysregulated in cancer cells, suggesting that learning how RSV subverts nuclear export pathways may have a direct impact on elucidating how gene expression is controlled in normal and transformed cells. The model that newly synthesized mRNAs have their cytoplasmic fates decided in the nucleus is generally accepted, although how pre-mRNA nuclear retention factors prevent the export of unspliced RNAs represents a significant gap in understanding. To address this question, we used RNA affinity capture to identify nuclear proteins that bound to the retroviral 5' untranslated region (UTR). We identified several regulators of splicing and proteins involved in nuclear pre-mRNA surveillance and retention. Based on these preliminary results, our overarching hypothesis is that pre-mRNA nuclear retention factors compete with the RSV Gag protein for newly transcribed viral RNA to decide whether the RNA becomes destined for genome packaging or translation. We will test this hypothesis in two specific aims. First, we will determine whether the nuclear retention factorU2AF65 (U2 snRNP auxiliary factor large subunit) is involved in  marking  the population of unspliced RSV RNA destined for use in translation. Second, we will determine whether competition between Tpr, a pre-mRNA nuclear retention factor, and Gag for binding the highly structured 5' UTR acts as a switch that regulates the cytoplasmic fate of the unspliced RSV RNA for translation versus packaging. These experimental results will have a significant impact on understanding cellular mechanisms that prevent the nuclear export of unspliced pre-mRNAs and how retroviruses circumvent these quality control measures to express and package their genomes.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Retroviruses subvert normal cellular regulatory pathways to export their unspliced RNAs from the nucleus to target this RNA for two different fates: translation or encapsidation into new virions. Many mRNA regulatory pathways are altered in cancer, however little is known about how mRNA cytoplasmic fate is determined in normal or transformed cells. This application seeks to understand how cellular proteins in the nucleus dictate the cytoplasmic fate of retroviral RNAs.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary goal of this proposal is to investigate the mechanism whereby respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) modulates innate immunity and cell survival through the mitochondrial system following RSV infection, and to combine this knowledge with nanoparticle technology to develop new ways to prevent and treat RSV infections. Veterans commonly have some form of chronic lung disease and are especially susceptible to respiratory viral infections like those caused by RSV and influenza. RSV is an opportunistic human respiratory pathogen that causes bronchiolitis in infants and pneumonia in immunocompromised adults and the elderly with an estimated 64 million infections and 166,000 deaths annually worldwide. RSV is becoming more and more of a serious threat to aging veterans. Despite progress, the precise nature of the RSV-induced innate immune response remains unclear. Our preliminary evidence shows that the NS1 protein associates with mitochondria and is found in complex with the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein in RSV-infected A549 epithelial cells and inhibits the signaling of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and MAVS occurring via the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD). This interferes with IFN-2 production which inhibits the innate immune response. NS1 also blocks programmed cell death (apoptosis) of infected cells and prevents loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, thus promoting cell (and viral) survival. These data have led to the hypothesis that RSV utilizes NS1 to attenuate RIG-I- MAVS-induced antiviral IFN-2 production and to modulate mitochondrial function for increasing cell survival. The study of the precise mechanisms underlying these processes is expected to lead to the discovery of new targets for preventing or limiting RSV infection. To test these hypotheses, the following specific aims are proposed. In the first aim, it is planned to examine the role of NS1 in attenuating RIG-I/MAVS signaling during RSV infection. This includes analysis of the role of NS1 in regulating MAVS, LGP2 and RIG-1 expression and in attenuation of IFN-2 response during RSV infection, mitochondrial localization of NS1 protein and structure-function relationships of NS1- MAVS interaction. The second aim will focus on determining whether the NS1- MAVS interaction is required to prevent premature apoptosis and intrinsic cell death. This also includes addressing whether the NS1-MAVS complex is associated with anti- or pro-apoptotic factors and modulates their expression on the mitochondrial membrane. In the third aim, it is planned to develop and test targeted chlipid (chitosan-lipid) nanoparticles as a therapeutic agent for RSV-induced lung disease. These chlipids encapsulate a plasmid that encodes siRNAs for LGP2 and NS1 and a peptide for MAVS (referred to as pLMNS1), each of which individually has been shown to significantly down- regulate RSV replication in human cells. Lastly, in the fourth aim it is proposed to evaluate targeted nanoparticle-encapsulated pLMNS1 for treating RSV disease in a mouse model. The proposed research will be conducted by an excellent group of investigators with a proven track record in RSV disease, apoptosis and nanoparticle technology. The results are expected to lead to the discovery of novel targets and to the initiation of preclinical studies of these targets against RSV lung disease.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Antibiotic prescribing in Clostridium difficile transmission and control Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Health Care Our work will provide valuable information on the effectiveness and cost-benefit of different control policies for Clostridium difficile. By examining the associations between facility-level antibiotic prescribing and C. difficile infection (CDI) rates, and the impac and costs of various control strategies for CDI, we may gain a better understanding of the dynamics of C. difficile transmission in ways that will contribute to the implementation of VA-wide initiatives aimed at controlling CDI, such as antibiotic stewardship. The findings from this project have the potential to impact infection control practice throughout the VA healthcare system. Project Background C. difficile is the predominant infectious cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and one of the most common types of healthcare-acquired infection, resulting in prolonged hospital stays, higher mortality, and increased healthcare costs. Exposure to antibiotics is the most important risk factor for CDI, presumably through the disruption of the normal fecal flora. Although a number of approaches have been proposed to contain outbreaks of CDI, such as improved hand hygiene and antibiotic stewardship, little is understood about how these interventions alter the dynamics of C. difficile transmission and acquisition and contribute to its control. Project Objectives C. difficile transmission is dependent on the interactions of innumerable factors and processes. The design of policies to control nosocomial CDI is aided by an understanding of these interactions and the relative impact of different control strategies on C. difficile transmission dynamics. With this in mind, our objectives are to (a) perform a facility-level analysis of associations between antibiotic use patterns and CDI ratesat VA hospitals nationwide; (b) incorporate these patterns and associations into our agent-based simulation of nosocomial C. difficile transmission; (c) use the simulation to evaluate and compare alternative and novel policies for C. difficile control in VA hospitals, including antibiotc stewardship; and (d) explore the impact of these intervention strategies under varying conditions, including the introduction of an epidemic C. difficile strain. Methods We will refine and enhance a high-fidelity agent-based computer simulation of nosocomial C. difficile transmission created as part of a previous project. Our analyses of antibiotic prescribing and CDI rates will be based on a large, nationwide database of VA patient data that we have obtained from Patient Care Services. The combination of individual- and hospital-level data from more than 150 VA hospitals makes it feasible to fit models that separately estimate direct effects of antimicrobial agents on CDI risk from their indirect effects mediated through person-to-person spread. Hierarchical mixed effects models will be used to characterize the association of CDI rates to patient and hospital level factors. Results of these analyses will be incorporated into th simulation, which will then be used to assess the various strategies and factors that impact C. difficile transmission through a series of simulation experiments. Traditional quantitative epidemiologic methods will be used to analyze simulation results, with a focus on C. difficile incidence and transmission rates as outcomes. Dynamic cost-benefit analyses will also be performed by projecting C. difficile incidence rates and costs under the various alternative policyregimes.\",\n",
       " 'We are developing live-attenuated, intranasal, pediatric vaccines against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Building on years of molecular and biologic studies in the LID, we use reverse genetics systems of our design to produce highly defined vaccine candidates from cloned cDNAs. This provides well-defined vaccine viruses that can have improved properties and have attenuating mutations that can readily be monitored during manufacture and use. This also provides virus with a short, well-defined passage history that greatly reduces the chance of adventitious agents. The DNA intermediate also provides a stable vaccine seed and the means to modify the virus as necessary in response to clinical data. To date, the most promising live-attenuated RSV vaccine candidate, called rA2cp248/404/1030/delSH, exhibited genetic and phenotypic instability in clinical studies, and a more stable version would be desirable. Two missense attenuating mutations in the L protein were identified as being unstable, namely 831L and 1321N, with the latter mutation being the more unstable. We have therefore sought to stabilize these mutations in a version of rA2cp248/404/1030/delSH called MEDI-559. This involved evaluating the phenotypes of each of the possible 20 amino acids at each locus, and inspecting all possible attenuating codons to identify one requiring more than a single nucleotide change for de-attenuation. The need for 2 or 3 changes, rather than 1, would reduce the frequency of de-attenuation by orders of magnitude.   We were unable to identify such a codon for the 831 locus, although we did identify a codon for which single-nucleotide reversion was somewhat less frequent. In contrast, for the 1321 locus, we did succeed in identifying an attenuating codon requiring 2 nucleotide changes to revert to a wt-like assignment. In vitro stress tests (passage at increasing temperature to force reversion) identified a second-site compensatory mutation at nearby position 1313. However, we were able to stabilize that position. These improved codons were inserted into MEDI-559 to create the new virus cps-2. In vitro stress tests confirmed that it had substantially increased stability, and a study in seronegative chimpanzees showed that the level of attenuation of cps2 was indistinguishable from that of MEDI-559. Thus, this provides an improved vaccine candidate. We investigated creating new attenuating mutations in RSV by deletion of one or more codons in the L protein. This was done with the expectation that deletion of a codon would be more refractory to reversion than a missense mutation. Evaluation of 17 different deletions at 5 sites failed to produce viable virus, suggesting that deletion of an amino acid from a protein is less well tolerated than a missense mutation. However, deletion of a sixth site, namely 1313, resulted in a virus that replicated efficiently at the permissive temperature of 32C, necessary for efficient vaccine manufacture, but was temperature-sensitive, attenuated, and stable during in vitro stress tests. This identified a new attenuating mutation with promising properties. This del1313 mutation is presently being combined with other stable mutations to make new vaccine candidates. For example, combination with deletion of the NS2 interferon antagonist gene provided a new candidate that, in seronegative chimpanzees, was comparable in attenuation to MEDI-559 and cps2 and thus is a desirable new candidate. RSV infects and causes severe disease more frequently and earlier in infancy compared to other common respiratory viruses, suggesting that it is less sensitive to restriction by maternally-derived serum antibodies. RSV also is able to re-infect symptomatically (but usually with reduced disease) throughout life without antigenic change, which also is suggestive of inefficient restriction by host immunity. The virus has two viral neutralization antigens, the G and F surface glycoproteins, and the former is expressed as both membrane-bound and secreted (sG) forms due to the use of two different translational start codons, ATG-1 and ATG-48. We previously showed that sG reduces antibody-mediated restriction in two ways: by acting as an antigen decoy, and by inhibiting the antibody-mediated antiviral effects of Fc receptor-bearing leucocytes. We hypothesized this latter effect might involve cell-types such as macrophages, neutrophils and natural killer cells that contribute to viral clearance by phagocytosis of antibody-antigen complexes or by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Interference with complement-mediated antiviral effects also was possible. We therefore investigated antibody-mediated restriction of RSV and effects of sG. We found that sG did not directly inhibit phagocytosis by macrophages. It also did not detectably inhibit the activation of pulmonary macrophages in mice. We also found that natural antibodies (background antibodies produced without antigen stimulation) do not appear to play a role in restricting and resolving RSV replication in RSV-naive mice. Depletion experiments showed that neutrophils did not appear to be significantly antiviral, either in RSV-naive mice or in mice that had received passive RSV-neutralizing antibodies. Macrophage depletion experiments showed that this cell-type is important in restricting RSV replication, both in RSV-naive mice and in mice that were given passive RSV-neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, sG interfered with antibody-mediated restriction by macrophages. Finally, depletion experiments showed that the complement system does not play a significant role in restricting virus in RSV-naive mice, but is important for antibody-mediated restriction and is subject to inhibition by sG. These results highlighted the importance of macrophages and complement in restricting RSV replication, and demonstrated the ability of sG to interfere with both mechanisms. Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), a relative of RSV, causes respiratory disease in mice. There is serologic evidence suggesting widespread exposure of humans to PVM. To investigate replication in primates, African green monkeys (AGM) and rhesus macaques were inoculated with PVM by the respiratory route. Virus was shed intermittently at low levels by a subset of animals, suggesting poor permissiveness. PVM efficiently replicated in cultured human cells and inhibited the type I interferon (IFN) response in these cells. This suggests that poor replication in non-human primates was not due to a general non-permissiveness of primate cells or poor control of the IFN response. Seroprevalence in humans was examined by screening sera from 30 adults and 17 young children for PVM neutralizing activity. Sera from 6% of children and 40% of adults had low neutralizing activity against PVM, which could be consistent with increasing incidence of exposure following early childhood. There was no cross-reaction of human or AGM immune sera between RSV and PVM, and no cross-protection in the mouse model. In native Western blots, human sera reacted with RSV but not PVM proteins under conditions where AGM immune sera reacted strongly. Serum reactivity was further evaluated by flow cytometry using unfixed Vero cells infected with PVM or RSV expressing GFP as a measure of viral gene expression. The reactivity of human sera against RSV-infected cells correlated with GFP expression, whereas reactivity against PVM-infected cells was low and uncorrelated with GFP expression. Thus, PVM-specificity was not evident. Our results indicate that the PVM-neutralizing activity of human sera is not due to RSV- or PVM-specific antibodies but may be due to natural IgG antibodies. The absence of PVM-specific antibodies and restriction in non-human primates make PVM unlikely to be a human pathogen.',\n",
       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and small children. RSV infection in mice is characterized by significant immunopathology which is mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Past studies have suggested that CD8+ T cells with different functional properties and characteristics can be elicited following infection or immunization, and may have differential effects on viral clearance and RSV-associated illness.  We have described differences between neonatal and adult CD8+ T cell responses elicited during RSV infection.  Differences in clonotype, functional avidity, and other intrinsic parameters of the CD8+ T cell response may help dictate the epitope hierarchy established following infection.   We are currently evaluating lung dendritic cell responses, and the elicitation of adaptive responses in both neonates and adults.  This work has been greatly aided within the last year by the development of three strains of transgenic  mice with CD8+ T cells specific for RSV.  Continued work on this study will fully characterize CD8+ T responses to RSV, elucidate important factors that dictate the type of CD8+ T cell response that is generated, and help understand how other cell types regulate the CD8+ T cell response to result in either a beneficial or a detrimental effect.',\n",
       " 'Plague is a zoonosis that is present in wild rodent populations worldwide and is transmitted primarily by fleas. Yersinia pestis, the plague bacillus, is unique among the enteric group of gram-negative bacteria in having adopted an arthropod-borne route of transmission. Y. pestis has evolved in such a way as to be transmitted during the brief encounter between a feeding flea and a host. A transmissible infection primarily depends on the ability of Y. pestis to grow in the flea as a biofilm that is embedded in a complex extracellular matrix. Bacteria in the biofilm phenotype are deposited into the dermis together with flea saliva, elements which cannot be satisfactorily mimicked by needle-injection of Y. pestis from laboratory cultures. The objective of this project is to identify and determine the function of Y. pestis genes that mediate flea-borne transmission and the initial encounter with the host innate immune system at the infection site in the skin. We study the interaction of Y. pestis with its insect vector by using an artificial feeding apparatus to infect fleas with uniform doses of wild-type or specific Y. pestis mutants. We seek to identify Y. pestis genes that are required for the bacteria to infect the flea midgut and to produce a biofilm that blocks the flea foregut and that is required for efficient transmission. The strategy entails first identifying bacterial genes that are differentially expressed in the flea by gene expression analysis and other techniques. Specific mutations are then introduced into these genes, and the mutants tested for their ability to infect and block the flea vector. Identification of such transmission factors allows further studies into the molecular mechanisms of the bacterial infection of the flea vector. Detailed understanding of the interaction with the insect host may lead to novel strategies to interrupt the transmission cycle.\\tDuring the last year, we continued to investigate the regulation of Y. pestis genes required for the biofilm life stage in the flea vector. The bacterial second messenger cyclic-di-GMP is a key positive regulator of the biofilm phenotype.  Our previous work showed that Y. pestis has two genes that function to synthesize c-di-GMP. This year we showed that biofilm development is negatively regulated by the multicomponent Rcs signal transduction- gene regulatory system of Y. pestis because the Rcs system represses transcription of one of the c-di-GMP-synthesizing genes. We also continue to investigate the genetic changes that led to the evolutionarily recent transition of Y. pestis to an arthropod-borne transmission route.  Many nonfunctional genes (pseudogenes) occur on the Y. pestis genome; some of them are implicated in regulating the biofilm phenotype that enhances transmission by fleas.  We have found that restoration of three pseudogenes with the equivalent functional genes of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, the recent ancestor of Y. pestis, reduces transmissibility in the flea; and conversely, mutation of these genes in Y. pseudotuberculosis results in the gain of biofilm-forming ability in the flea.  Thus, gene loss appears to have played a significant role in Y. pestis evolution. In collaboration with the Genomics Unit of the RML Research Technologies Branch, we are examining and characterizing the transcriptomes of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and our biofilm-producing Y. pseudotuberculosis mutant during growth in vitro and during infection of the flea, with the goal of identifying genes and gene regulatory pathways that are important for flea-borne transmission. The in vivo and in vitro transcriptomic comparisons between these three strains are designed to broadly identify candidate components of biofilm regulatory pathways and other genes important for the recent evolutionary adaptation to flea-borne transmission. Significant differences in the expression of orthologous genes in the flea might be indicative of evolutionary changes in gene regulatory pathways. Moreover, the comparison of Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis transcripts grown in vitro would help us to select gene candidates involved in the acute toxicity of Y. pseudotuberculosis for fleas.  In a separate study, we investigated the possible role of Y. pestis insecticidal-like toxins that are highly expressed during infection of the flea. We have also further developed models to examine host-parasite interactions in the dermis after transmission by flea bite, and are completing a project on the host immune response to flea saliva and how this might influence transmission.  Last year we established a colony of the ground- and rock-squirrel flea Oropsylla montana, an important vector of plague in the U.S.  This year we have done several experimental transmission trials to compare biofilm-independent early-phase and biofilm-dependent transmission mechanisms, and the overall transmission efficiency and the biofilm-dependent blockage ability of Y. pestis in X. cheopis and O. montana fleas.',\n",
       " 'In collaboration with Dr. Fernando Polack (Vanderbilt University) and the Infant Foundation in Buenos Aires, Argentina we recruited a prospective cohort of children aged 0-9 months of age from 5 hospitals in Buenos Aires. The primary clinical outcome is severity of disease (O2 saturation < 93%) and the secondary outcomes are RSV titer and Th2 polarization (blood lymphocytes are isolated and challenged with pro-inflammatory agonists including LPS). From 2003-2006, we recruited approximately 800 children to the study: 400 infected with RSV (240 with severe disease, 160 with mild disease) and 400 controls (uninfected). Our initial genetic analyses have focused on the role of functional SNPs in TLR4 (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile), and NRF2 (-653A/G, -651G/A and -617C/A). These genes have been identified as candidate susceptibility genes for RSV infection in mice, and TLR4 has also been associated with RSV infection in children. In our initial analyses, we found that the -651G/A SNP was only found in severe RSV cases and conferred greater risk of disease relative to the wild type (OR: 1.9; CI: 1.4, 2.7). We also found that children heterozygous for the Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile mutations in TLR4 were at higher risk of severe RSV disease relative to children with wild-type TLR4 genotype (OR: 1.7; CI: 1.2, 2.6). However, when socioeconomic status (SES) was considered, we found children from low SES families and heterozygous for TLR4 Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile mutations had significantly less severe disease compared to wild type (4% severe disease vs 11% severe disease, p<0.05) compared with children from middle/high SES (9% severe disease vs 2% mild disease, p<0.05). These results are consistent with a role for TLR4 in RSV disease severity, but interaction of TLR4 genotype with environment must be considered when evaluating risk of these mutations. We have used human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL; Coriell Institute) to evaluate inter-individual variation in response to RSV, test the role of candidate susceptibility genes, and identify basal gene expression patterns that predict RSV responsivity. Databases on human sequence variation (dbSNP and HapMap) and functional annotation were queried for relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and used to select LCLs with particular genotypes with SNPs of interest. These LCLs were infected with RSV and significant inter-individual variation in RSV infectivity across multiple LCLs indicated that genetic background is an important determinant of suscepti bility to infection. Moreover, enhanced (3-5 fold) viral load was found in LCLs with a non-synonymous coding SNP (rs469390) in MX1, which is involved in suppressing viral replication in infected cells. In a case control study of infants with mild or severe RSV disease, a positive association was found between individuals homozygous for the minor allele of rs469390 and development of severe disease. We also developed a model to predict RSV infection using data from individuals in the HapMap collection. Baseline mRNA expression of HapMap individuals from six different microarray data sets were initially assessed for correlation with viral load. Of transcripts that were positively correlated, the 5 highest and 5 lowest viral load responders were selected for the model, resulting in 61 genes that associated with viral load and were differentially expressed in at least 3 of 6 baseline data sets. Using heuristic modeling of the 61 genes, a 27 gene transcript model was the best predictor (RSV prediction, p<0.001; rsq 0.95) of viral load in individuals for which infection response had already been quantified. We found 75% accuracy in predicting RSV infectivity in test set LCLs with similar expression profiles. This novel cell model of RSV disease can thus be used translationally to identify functionally relevant candidate susceptibility genes. We also developed a mouse model of RSV disease by infecting 34 inbred mouse strains (JAX) with RSV-19 or vehicle control. Significant inter-strain variation in protein, cellular, mucus cell metaplasia (MCM), and RSV-N mRNA expression phenotypes following infection were found among the 34 inbred strains. The most severe RSV disease pathology was found in A/J and Balb/cJ mice, while C3H/HeJ mice were among the most resistant. Collaborating with Dr. Tim Wiltshire (UNC), we then used the SNPster algorithm for haplotype association mapping (HAM) of maximum RSV response phenotypes. Significant associations were found for MCM, RSV-N mRNA, and BAL monocytes, lymphocytes, and PMNs. The most significant association was found on chromosome 1 for BAL monocytes. Within this region are 6 genes that have SNPs that associate with BAL monocytes, including Marco. We identified a non-synonymous coding SNP (rs30741725) that causes a threonine to serine substitution in amino acid 476, and based on predicted protein structure change, this substitution severely affects receptor binding. Further, RSV-induced BAL monocytes and lymphocytes were significantly greater 5 d PI in strains that are homozygous for this SNP relative to strains that have the wild type allele, suggesting a functional role for the mutation in RSV disease. We also found that relative to Marco+/+ mice, significantly greater histopathological changes and numbers of monocytes and PMNs were found in Marco-/- mice 5 d PI providing additional evidence for a protective role for Marco in RSV disease. Collaborating with Dr. Fernando Polack, each subject from the RSV cohort (described above) was genotyped for a functional SNP in the MARCO promoter (rs3806496; chrom 2, 119.698574 Mb). Logistic regression was used for analysis where the response variable was O2 saturation. The allele frequency of MARCO (T allele) was 0.47 and in HWE. The likelihood ratio test was 16.8 with 1 df, p=4x10-5. The relative risk estimate for the T allele is 0.66 which means that it is protective or the C allele (RR=1.52) is causative. While essential to repeat these findings in another independent population, these novel studies support the hypothesis that MARCO is an important determinant of RSV disease severity, and demonstrates the translational value of the model to understand human RSV disease.We then used a combined genetics and genomics approach (genetical genomics) to understand the genetic basis of RSV disease susceptibility. To identify transcripts differentially expressed at baseline that predict response to RSV, baseline lung gene transcript expression for 29 inbred mouse strains (Novartis) was correlated to phenotype data from the RSV strain screen (described above) using linear and random forest regression. These analyses identified a battery of gene transcripts that were differentially expressed at baseline and significantly correlated with RSV disease severity including Ptgs2 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2), Nqo1 (NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1), and IL18bp (interleukin 18 binding protein). To determine whether genotype differences account for differential gene expression we utilized expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis using FastMap. At baseline, there were 125 genes with significant cis-eQTLs, where an association exists between gene expression and genotype at that particular genes locus. Expression of three of these genes significantly correlated with RSV disease phenotypes. Together, these approaches have identified genetic markers of susceptibility to RSV disease to predict severe responders and potentially provide more effective therapeutic targets.',\n",

       " 'Objective(s): Objective 1:  Identify the molecular determinants of efficient tick-borne transmission of Anaplasma marginale through comparison of pathogen strains with distinctly different transmission phenotypes.  Subobjective 1.A:  Compare the tick colonization and transmission efficiency phenotypes of A. marginale subsp. centrale before and after tick selection.  Subobjective 1.B: Identify genetic markers that are predictive of the tick transmission phenotype of A. marginale field strains.  Objective 2:  Identify the molecular determinants of vector competence with the goal of blocking tick transmission of Anaplasma marginale.  Subobjective 2.A:  Define the proteome of the A. marginale-containing vacuole in cultured tick cells.  Subobjective 2.B:  Identify tick proteins that are required for A. marginale replication in tick cell culture.  Subobjective 2.C:  Identify tick-specific genes that are required for A. marginale transmission.  Objective 3:  Assess the capacity to induce protective immunity to challenge by identifying and testing subdominant Anaplasma marginale antigens with the goal of developing a crossprotective vaccine.  Subobjective 3.A:  Identify the widely conserved outer membrane proteins that induce broadly cross-reactive antibody.  Subobjective 3.B:  Test the ability of the proteins identified in subobjective 3.A to induce protection to homologous and heterologous A. marginale challenge.  Approach: Anaplasma marginale, the causative agent of anaplasmosis, is the most prevalent tick-borne pathogen of livestock worldwide. This bacterial pathogen causes a significant disease burden to cattle in the United States and is a barrier to trade. The tools currently available to control this disease are limited and rely on treatment of clinically affected animals and tick control. The work proposed here is designed to fill knowledge gaps required for development of more effective control strategies. In the proposed experiments we target two points of control, one aimed at preventing infection of the bovine host, and the other aimed at preventing tick transmission. Using a comparative approach, we will identify genetic markers of highly efficient tick transmission in A. marginale, thus allowing for the development of a vaccine targeting potential outbreak strains. Concurrently, we will identify and test conserved subdominant antigens for the ability to induce protection against homologous and heterologous challenge in cattle. Together these data will guide the development of an effective vaccine. Using a proteomics approach followed by RNAi experiments to knock-down specific gene function, we will identify the molecules unique to the tick that are required for A. marginale transmission. Identification of these molecules will lay the foundation for development of novel methods to block transmission of A. marginale at the level of the tick vector.',\n",
       " 'What determines how fast a disease spreads through a population may depend on how fast the disease spreads inside an infected individual so that processes within an individual are important for understanding disease transmission between individuals. Often, disease data are collected at a single scale of reference, such as within the individual, and other scales are ignored. This research will develop statistical methods and models that bring together information across scales ranging from the individual to the landscape. The experimental data used to develop these models will focus on an easily manipulated host-pathogen interaction between the fall armyworm and its lethal pathogen, a baculovirus. The models of transmission dynamics derived from the experimental data will quantify the extent that smaller scale processes affect larger scale dynamics and whether or not ignoring scale matters.In general, the modeling framework developed can be used to understand disease transmission, forecast transmission probability, and outbreak severity for other diseases including human pathogens. From an agricultural perspective, lethal baculoviruses represent a biological insecticide.  This research will aid in their use and development. Additionally, this multidisciplinary project will involve a number of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The research conducted will train the next generation of statisticians, ecologists, and pathologists who will strengthen the ideas and methodologies generated from working across these disciplines.',\n",
       " \"The transmission eigenvalue problem has attracted many researchers in the scattering and inverse scattering communities recently. Although simply stated, the problem is not covered by any standard theory of partial differential equations. Numerical treatment of transmission eigenvalues is very limited to date. Effective numerical methods will enhance the understanding of the problem and provide tools for mathematicians and engineers to compute transmission eigenvalues. This proposal aims at robust numerical methods for transmission eigenvalues for the Helmholtz equation and the Maxwell''s equations. In particular, the following research topics will be carried out. 1) Iterative methods for the Helmholtz equation. Based on a fourth order reformulation, an associated generalized eigenvalue problem will be solved by the finite element method. Then iterative methods will be applied to search roots of a related algebraic function which turn out to be the transmission eigenvalues. 2) Continuous finite element method for the Maxwell''s equations. The transmission eigenvalue problem of the Maxwell''s equations will be written in a suitable weak form first. Then the curl conforming edge elements will be used to compute the transmission eigenvalues. 3) Iterative methods for the anisotropic Maxwell''s equations. This approach is again based on a forth order reformulation of the transmission eigenvalue  problem of the anisotropic Maxwell''s equations. An associated generalized Maxwell''s eigenvalue problem will be used to set up an algebraic equation whose roots are the transmission eigenvalues. Then iterative methods can be applied to search the roots of the algebraic equation. It is an extension of the iterative methods for the Helmholtz equation. However, the case for the Maxwell''s equations is much more difficult and require additional technical treatment.The proposed research will be a pioneer numerical study on transmission eigenvalues for the Helmholtz equation and the Maxwell''s equations. The results are important for the development of mathematical theory for transmission eigenvalues and can be used to compare various estimates in inverse scattering theory.  The proposed research will provide mathematicians and engineers reliable tools to compute transmission eigenvalues. It will lead to new methods for studying the inverse scattering problems such as inverse electromagnetic scattering problem for anisotropic media. Since transmission eigenvalues can be used to estimate material properties of the scattering object, the proposed research has potential usage in non-destructive testing, geophysical applications, medical imaging, etc. For example, it is possible to detect the presence of cavities in the dielectric from the location of the transmission eigenvalues. The numerical results will be disseminated to mathematician for analytical study of transmission eigenvalues and engineers for detection and reconstruction of unknown objects. In addition, successful accomplishment of the proposed project will enhance the research capacity of the university and provide graduate students valuable research opportunities.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. They are often referred to collectively as a high-risk group, but this generalization belies the fact that there is a high degree of heterogeneity of HIV risk within the population. Certain socio-ecological factors place some MSM at higher risk for HIV. There are a number of potential drivers of the HIV epidemic, including substance use, undiagnosed infections and high number of sexual partners. However, these broad categories need refinement in order to identify transmission patterns, as it remains unclear which drivers are contributing to the epidemic with HIV transmission as the biological outcome. Real-time identification of epidemiological hot spots, pinpointing the chains of viral transmission and biologically linking drivers of the epidemic are needed to effectively target prevention strategies and interrupt these chains of HIV transmission. Increasing use of antiretroviral (ARV) resistance testing in response to revised clinical guidelines has enriched theavailability of viral sequences to study HIV transmission epidemiology. DNA sequencing can be used to establish epidemiological linkages between infected persons. Such linkages are referred to as HIV transmission clusters, comprised of cases whose viruses share sufficient phylogenetic similarities to suggest a recent common source of infection or participation in linked chains of transmission. Identifying clusters that account for the largest proportion of onward transmissions and characterizing the structural, behavioral and biological correlates that predict transmissibility would inform the development of targeted interventions. The proposed study will use a combination of biological, epidemiological, behavioral and psychosocial research tools to obtain an innovative perspective on the HIV epidemic among MSM. The specific aims are: 1) to characterize HIV transmission clusters and correlates associated with transmission; 2) to evaluate the relative impact of acute, recent and long-term HIV infections on transmission clusters; and 3) to assess HIV transmission cluster patterns in relation to attempted risk reduction strategies. We are poised to analyze viral sequences to elucidate the key patterns of HIV transmission. We will enhance the utility of existing data by creating a population-based, analytical database that will harmonize an urban area's HIV/AIDS case registry with viral resistance and sexually transmitted diseases databases. Qualitative interviews will be conducted to describe the psychosocial and behavioral contexts at the level of the transmission cluster to complement the phylogenetic data. Using an adapted Social Ecological model as a conceptual framework, the interviews will elicit seroconversion narratives and obtain detailed data on any specific strategies attempted to prevent HIV transmission. Real-time analysis of HIV transmission cluster data will place us on the leading edge of the epidemic and enable assessment of how high-risk clusters and current prevention strategies affect transmission patterns.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rickettsia felis was originally identified in the United States as a human pathogen in 1991; and, with increased recognition worldwide, it is now realized that human infections caused by R. felis account for up to 6% of the causes of fever among non-malarial conditions in sub-Saharan Africa. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that are critical to rickettsial transmission by fleas in order to better understand the epidemiology of flea-borne rickettsial diseases and identify points of intervention. In addition to being a horizontally transmitted flea-borne pathogen, R. felis is alsoa vertically maintained endosymbiont of non-hematophagous insects. For arthropod-borne Rickettsia spp., the level of virulence is expected to be governed by the relative importance of vertical and horizontal transmission for maintenance of the rickettsiae. Therefore, the central hypothesis being tested is that there are host-dependent mechanisms that are essential to rickettsial virulence and transmission. The mechanism by which R. felis differentiates the host environment and executes either horizontal or vertical routes for successful transmission and maintenance in arthropod populations are not known. The experimental focus of this proposal is to delineate the Rickettsia- and arthropod-dependent factors contributing to successful horizontal transmission through comparative and functional analyses of R. felis in different arthropod hosts, and at the arthropod-host interface. The biological and molecular events underlying the transmission of R. felis in flea hosts are poorly defined and are critical to clearl understanding the epidemiology of flea-borne rickettsial diseases and identify points of intervention. The previously undefined parameters of rickettsial infection in fleas will be determined in the following specific aims Aim 1. Characterization of rickettsial transcript expression profile in cat fleas compared to non- hematophagous arthropods. Using RNA-seq, expressed rickettsial transcripts will be identified in R. felis- infected fleas, during flea hematophagy, and in rickettsiae deposited into blood during horizontal transmission between cofeeding fleas. Comparisons will be made to constitutively infected booklice. Subsequently, unique rickettsial transcripts will be functionally characterized via targeted gene disruption and their requirement for horizontal transmission assessed. Utilizing in vivo systems, we will be able to test the hypothesis that R. felis has an essential transcript profile necessary for horizontal transmission during flea bloodmeal acquisition. Aim 2. Determination of cat flea-derived salivary gland secreted factors essential for horizontal transmission of Rickettsia. The salivary gland transcription profile has been initially characterized in cat fleas and salivary gland transcripts identified as secreted molecules will be assessed in R. felis-infected cat fleas during the feedingperiod. Differentially expressed transcripts associated with R. felis infection of fleas will be functionally characterized by RNA-mediated interference and the necessity of these flea- derived factors for horizontal transmission assessed. Utilizing a horizontal transmission bioassay, the hypothesis that flea-derived factors are essential to successful horizontal transmission of R. felis will be tested.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): General anesthetics have numerous molecular targets, including ligand-gated and voltage-gated ion channels, and modulation of these targets results in either an enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission or a suppression of excitatory neurotransmission. These effects are expected to underlie the capacity of anesthetics to produce amnesia, unconsciousness, and immobility; however, knowledge of which targets are essential for mediating anesthetic actions and the relative importance of each target to different behavioral endpoints is lacking. The primary goal of this proposal is to understand how modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission, and more specifically NMDA receptor- mediated transmission, is connected to anesthetic-induced amnesia. Although numerous in vivo studies have shown the ability of NMDA antagonists to impair memory, it is not clear how much NMDA receptor-mediated transmission needs to be blocked to cause amnesia. Using a selective NMDA receptor antagonist we will determine the concentration of the antagonist in the brain of mice at doses that impair learning and memory and then in vitro, using hippocampal brain slice recording, we will determine how much the determined concentration suppresses NMDA receptor-mediated transmission. Whether the modulation of NMDA-mediated synaptic transmission also contributes in part or completely to amnesia induced by the widely used inhaled anesthetic isoflurane is unknown. Therefore we will determine the amount of modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission associated with an amnestic concentration of isoflurane. The objective is to establish a quantitative relationship between the actions of anesthetics at the synaptic level to the behavioral level. These studies will improve our understanding of the actions of anesthetics and identify what role the modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission plays in anesthetic induced amnesia.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Virus-like particles (VLPs) provide great potential to develop future vaccines against highly pathogenic viral pathogens. VLPs mimic the virus in structure and morphology, but are non-infectious, featuring a high safety profile. The goal of our proposed project is to develop vaccine technology based on recombinant VLPs. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus are important respiratory viral pathogens. There is no licensed vaccine against RSV. There are 9 times more deaths by RSV than those by influenza among young infants. The fact that licensed RSV drugs are based on antibodies highly supports the possibility to develop an effective RSV vaccine. We have developed RSV VLP vaccines that are proven to be effective in preventing RSV enhanced disease from recent feasibility studies. However, RSV VLP vaccine technology is in an early stage of development and much study is needed to provide sufficient preclinical efficacy data of RSV VLP vaccines. We hypothesize that RSV VLP vaccines developed in our feasibility studies will be highly effective in inducing protective immunity against RSV. In the specific aim 1, we will focus on obtaining sufficient proof-of-concept efficacy data of RSV VLP vaccines as well as testing long-term immunity and non-needle delivery technologies (intranasal, microneedle skin, and oral vaccination). As for aim 2, we will develop antigen targeting vaccine adjuvant systems by using molecularly adjuvanted VLP technology and test licensed adjuvants. Also, utilizing VLP vaccine technology, we have developed a promising universal influenza VLP vaccine and obtained sufficient proof-of-concept efficacy data, which is expected to significantly improve the current egg-substrate based influenza vaccines. In the aim 3, we will extend the preclinical efficacy tests of VLP vaccines to cotton rats (RSV VLPs) and ferrets (novel universal influenza VLPs). VLP vaccines proposed in this application will provide an excellent system to prove VLP vaccine technologies which are also applicable to other biodefense pathogens.',\n",
       " 'Acute respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children, elderly and in immunocompromised patients, as well as of asthma exacerbations. No effective treatment or vaccine for RSV is currently available, and many fundamental questions regarding the pathogenesis of RSV-induced lung disease have yet to be answered. In the past project period, we pioneered work demonstrating the importance of oxidative injury in the pathogenesis of RSV infection, and the possible use of antioxidant intervention for this infection. Our new data provide novel mechanistic evidence in support of these findings, as we show that RSV infection results in downregulation of antioxidant enzyme (AOE) gene expression in human airway epithelial cells (hAECs), in mouse lung, and in children with bronchiolitis. Nuclear levels of NFE2- related factor 2 (Nrf2), which regulates basal and inducible expression of AOE genes, are significantly decreased in response to RSV infection both in hAECs and in mouse lungs, while expression/activity of AOE negative transcriptional regulators is increased in response to RSV infection. The central hypothesis for our next grant period is that ROS production, along with the inhibition of cytoprotective AOE expression due to decreased Nrf2-dependent gene transcription, leads to clinical manifestations of RSV infection. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that antagonism between positive and negative transcriptional regulators determines the level of AOE gene expression in the context of viral infection. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that increased antioxidant cellular defenses decrease ROS production, oxidative stress and lung disease in response to RSV infection. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that decreased AOE gene expression is associated with greater severity of illness in infants with naturally acquired RSV infection. This project is synergistic with all the other projects of this Program Project, as it will include experiments linked to the fundamental scientific questions asked in P I . P3 and P4. related to the role of ROS-dependent activation of NF-KB (PI), formation of 8-oxoguanine. which triggers novel GTPase-dependent cellular signaling (P3). and ROS-dependent signaling in response to allergen stimulation (P4). Completion of our studies will provide critical new information elucidating an important and novel molecular pathway by which respiratory viruses induce lung inflammation, with strong implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies ifor lower respiratory tract infections and virus-triggered precipitation of asthma attacks.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the most common cause of hospital admission for children, and in the elderly population RSV is the second most common cause of death from respiratory infection after influenza virus. Most studies of RSV infection on the cellular level have been performed in cultured, immortalized cells. In these cells, RSV binds to heparan sulfate (HS), a complex oligosaccharide on the cell surface, as its primary receptor to initiate infection. In primary, well differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, an excellent model for the airway cells that RSV targets, RSV infects only ciliated cells and only via the apical surface. But this surface has no detectable HS. RSV must, therefore, use a different receptor to enter these cells. The goals of this project are to identify that receptor and the site on the RSV attachment protein that binds to it. Both will provide novel targets for the development of novel antiviral agents against RSV.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in children and infants, affecting an estimated 64 million people and causing 160,000 deaths worldwide per year (WHO). Each year in the United States, ~100,000 infants and ~170,000 adults are hospitalized due to RSV infection. High-risk adults (elderly and patients with chronic heart or lung disease) experience the highest RSV-attributed mortality in the US (~14,000 deaths/year), similar to the rates of seasonal influenza. The annual cost of RSV on the US healthcare system is ~$2 billion. Currently, no vaccines or disease-specific therapeutics are available to combat RSV, and treatment is mostly limited to supportive care. For the most acute cases, ribavirin, a broad-range antiviral with questionable efficacy and significant safety issues can be used, though it is not indicated for adults. Only onepreventative is available, Synagis (Palivizumab), a monoclonal antibody that inhibits RSV infection, but its use is limited to high-risk infants. Synagis is very expensive (~$5000 for a course of therapy) and reduces RSV-related hospitalizations of high-risk infants by only 55%. There is an urgent need for new anti-RSV prophylactics and therapies that can be applied to a broad patient population. In this project we will apply an innovative strategy to identify novel, protease-resistant D-peptide drug candidates for the critically underserved RSV patient population. Our drug discovery platform employs an enantiomeric screening technology (mirror-image phage display) coupled with protein design, to identify D- peptides that stop the virus as itattempts to enter a cell. We have successfully validated this platform technology by identifying a promising anti-HIV preclinical candidate, which is the most specific and potent D- peptide inhibitor known. Our anti-HIV D-peptide targets a conserved pocket found on a region of the HIV envelope protein, the N-trimer, which is transiently exposed during viral entry. It inhibits all maor circulating HIV-1 strains and, by design, possesses an extremely high barrier to resistance. RSV uses a highly similar mechanism of viral entry, and an analogous vulnerable pocket on the N-trimer has been identified on the RSV viral surface. This pocket will be the target for our discovery efforts. In this two-year Phase I SBIR, we propose to identify and structurally characterize 1st generation D-peptide RSV entry inhibitors. In Phase II we will rapidly apply all of the optimization techniques used in our HIV discovery efforts, which improved the potency of our HIV-specific drug by over six orders of magnitude and gave it an extraordinary resistance barrier. Once we have fully optimized the potency, specificity and resistance profile of our D-peptide RSV entry inhibitor, we will explore its utility as an anti-RSV therapeutic and preventative.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), the first tumor virus identified, has been the genesis for seminal discoveries in cancer biology and retrovirology, including oncogenes, reverse transcription, and fundamental aspects of retrovirus assembly. In our laboratory, we utilize RSV as a model system for dissecting mechanisms that regulate nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of proteins and RNAs during the process of retrovirus assembly. Recently we discovered that the RSV Gag protein, which orchestrates virus assembly from the plasma membrane, unexpectedly shuttles through the nucleus. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrated that RSV Gag selects its viral RNA genome in the nucleus, suggesting a novel paradigm for retroviral RNA packaging. Furthermore, our results suggest that the decision regarding whether the unspliced RSV RNA will be packaged into a virion or used to synthesize structural viral proteins is made in the nucleus. However, host pathways that influence the cytoplasmic destiny of RSV unspliced RNAs remain poorly understood. A further challenge is to decipher how RSV circumvents cellular mechanisms that block export of intron-containing pre-mRNAs, which are normally prevented from leaving the nucleus as part of the  quality control  machinery that regulates gene expression. Many of the mechanisms that regulate nuclear RNA export are dysregulated in cancer cells, suggesting that learning how RSV subverts nuclear export pathways may have a direct impact on elucidating how gene expression is controlled in normal and transformed cells. The model that newly synthesized mRNAs have their cytoplasmic fates decided in the nucleus is generally accepted, although how pre-mRNA nuclear retention factors prevent the export of unspliced RNAs represents a significant gap in understanding. To address this question, we used RNA affinity capture to identify nuclear proteins that bound to the retroviral 5' untranslated region (UTR). We identified several regulators of splicing and proteins involved in nuclear pre-mRNA surveillance and retention. Based on these preliminary results, our overarching hypothesis is that pre-mRNA nuclear retention factors compete with the RSV Gag protein for newly transcribed viral RNA to decide whether the RNA becomes destined for genome packaging or translation. We will test this hypothesis in two specific aims. First, we will determine whether the nuclear retention factorU2AF65 (U2 snRNP auxiliary factor large subunit) is involved in  marking  the population of unspliced RSV RNA destined for use in translation. Second, we will determine whether competition between Tpr, a pre-mRNA nuclear retention factor, and Gag for binding the highly structured 5' UTR acts as a switch that regulates the cytoplasmic fate of the unspliced RSV RNA for translation versus packaging. These experimental results will have a significant impact on understanding cellular mechanisms that prevent the nuclear export of unspliced pre-mRNAs and how retroviruses circumvent these quality control measures to express and package their genomes.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With an estimated 2.6 million new HIV infections in 2009, the world remains a long way from reaching the ambitious UNAIDS goal of zero new infections. In this context, prevention of HIV-1 transmission has been identified as a top Fiscal Year 2012 Trans-NIH AIDS Research Priority. In the wake of recent observational and randomized trial evidence that treatment provided to HIV-positive individuals can reduce transmission of the virus to their sex partners by as much as 96%, there is an urgent need for a new paradigm that redefines our understanding of transmission potential as it relates simultaneously to both sexual risk behavior and ART exposure. For HIV-positive women, who can now anticipate prolonged survival in the context of lifelong treatment, this will require an understanding of how transmission potential varies across the lifespan in relation to key reproductive health events including decisions about contraception, fertility desire, pregnancy, the post partum period, and menopause (hereafter, lifecourse events). Our objective in this multidisciplinary series of quantitative and qualitative studies is to characterize the presence, magnitude, and contextual basis of variations in HIV-positive Kenyan women's transmission potential in relation to these important lifecourse events. A prospective cohort design with collection of complementary behavioral and biological endpoints will provide strong evidence regarding the presence and temporal sequence of associations between lifecourse events and transmission potential, defined as unprotected sex in the setting of late ART refills. The open cohort study will include 360 HIV-positive Kenyan women who are offered ART in Mombasa and Nairobi. Participants will be recruited to represent three distinct and important risk groups; women in discordant couples, pregnant and post-partum women from maternal and child health clinics, and female sex workers. This diversity will provide substantial generalizability, as well s an opportunity to identify important differences in transmission potential between the three risk groups. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions will add to our understanding of the sociobehavioral context for changes in behavior. Our ability to leverage ongoing data collection from a cohort of HIV-positive women in Mombasa provides a unique advantage, as this will allow us to evaluate changes in transmission potential over more than 10 years in a subset of the study population. These studies will provide the most comprehensive data available to understand transmission potential in HIV-positive African women treated with ART. This research will directly improve public health, expanding our understanding of HIV prevention from a perspective that recognizes the potentially profound influence of HIV-positive women's reproductive lifecourse events on their transmission potential. These data are expected guide program implementation and inform development of a new generation of clinical trials to optimize prevention in an era where effective use of ART will take its place alongside condoms and abstinence as a cornerstone of prevention in positives.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections, morbidity, and mortality in infants and young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals worldwide. Despite decades of intensive research, treatment options are limited and in need of improvement. Non-structural proteins 1 (NS1) and 2 (NS2) are multifunctional proteins that play critical roles in RSV virulence and pathogenesis. NS1/2 are involved in host immune suppression, including inhibition of Type I interferon (IFN) induction and signaling, as well as inhibition of the NF-?B pathway and apoptosis. Although many host factors are thought to be targeted by RSV NS1/2 protein, currently no structures of NS1 or NS2 are available. The lack of structural studies limits our knowledge and corresponding mechanistic insights into immune evasion facilitated by these non-structural proteins. Moreover, this gap in knowledge also restricts our ability to develop countermeasures. In order to address this gap, we will (a) develop a structural and mechanistic understanding of viral immune antagonists NS1/2 proteins and (b) characterize their interactions with IFN production and response signaling pathways, including IRF3, STAT1, and STAT2 using biochemical and structural methods. Findings from these studies will be tested in vivo to identify residues critical for immune antagonist function. Through these studies, we expect to define the molecular basis for how RSV NS1/2 contributes to immune evasion and identify new targets for therapeutic and antiviral development.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Worldwide most HIV-1 infections are due to sexual transmission, however the precise source of HIV that contributes to mucosal transmission is poorly defined, in particular, whether the transmitted virus originate as cell-free or cell-associated viruses from the blood or the genital secretions of the infected individuals. Identifyin such information may help to design better and more targeted prevention efforts to block the establishment of infection. Multiple studies have shown that during sexual transmission HIV-1 viral diversity is significantly reduced and the newly transmitted HIV-1 variants that promotes establishment of infection could possibly be influenced by host and viral factors. Viral factors have been shown to increase transmission fitness of viruses and possibly favor early establishment of infection with the transmitting viruses having compact/shorter envelope hyper-variable loops and less potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS), relative to quasispecies present in the donor at the time of transmission. Host factors may also be important and recent studies showed that integrin alpha4beta7 (?4?7), a gut-homing receptor present on the activated CD4+ T cells in mucosal tissues has a specific affinity and binds to the HIV-1 envelope gp120, that could play a critical role in the infection of CD4+ T cells. Thus, the host and viral factors could provide a selective advantage for the newly sexually transmitted virus in launching a productive infection, but this hypothesis has yet to be tested in transmission pairs. In this proposed study we hypothesize that female-to- male sexually transmitted HIV-1 variants are cell-associated from genital secretions and the early transmitted viruses have unique properties that are distinct, and these characteristics may be influenced by viral and host factors. We propose to identify the primary source of HIV-1 variants that get selected for sexual transmission by examining the early transmitted viruses and comparing whether they are more similar to cell- associated or cell-free variants of chronically infected source partner in blood o genital compartments in transmission pairs from prospective discordant couple cohort. Additionally, we will examine the genetic properties of early transmitted viruses, like the envelope length, number of PNGS and presence of binding region of ?4?7 integrin homing receptor and compare them to viral sequences from source partner as well as sequences from non-transmitters. Furthermore, we will examine if the early transmitted variants that have 'exposed' ?4?7 binding site on V2 loop are highly efficient in binding the ?4?7receptor on CD4+ T cells compared to the viruses from chronically infected subjects by performing 'in-vitro' bindingexperiments.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long range goal of the proposed work is to understand the fundamental relationships between climate and vector-borne pathogen transmission. We will use more than a decade of research and data at multiple scales on the transmission ecology of West Nile virus (WNV) to determine mechanistic relationships of climate on mosquito populations and WNV transmission and the potential impacts of climate change. The proposed work addresses three specific aims: SA1) Determine the broad scale spatio-temporal correlations between rainfall and temperature and West Nile virus incidence in humans, mosquitoes, and birds, while controlling for land use. Use these patterns to generate mechanistic hypotheses about local scale processes generating these correlations.  We will use more than a decade of WNV incidence in birds, mosquitoes, and humans to determine the influence of temperature and rainfall on the length of WNV transmission season, the spatial distribution of WNV, and the intensity of WNV transmission. SA2) Test mechanistic hypotheses about climate-transmission links with laboratory studies and local scale data on temperature, rainfall, host abundance and WNV seroprevalence, and mosquito abundance, feeding patterns, and WNV infection prevalence.  We will perform laboratory studies to determine the influence of temperature on four critical factors in the transmission of vector-borne pathogens: vector competence, developmental rate, longevity, and biting rate of the three dominant WNV mosquito species.  We will use local studies of WNV transmission at 182 sites in 6 regions spanning the east-west and north-south dimensions of the USA to determine the influence of rainfall and temperature on mosquito abundance and the intensity of WNV transmission relative to other factors. SA3) Use hypotheses supported from SA2 to predict the impacts of climate change on future WNV transmission. We will develop fine scale future climate projections and use the insights gained from aims 1&2 to predict the effects of climate change on the distribution of WNV in North America, the length of the WNV transmission season, and the intensity of transmission across the USA.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As national malaria-control programs are intensifying and moving towards the goal of elimination, the primary focus has shifted from case management to the interruption of transmission. This will require the efficient and accurate identification of residual transmission foci that can be specifically targeted for elimination. Optimal surveillance systems should collect information on an ongoing basis to allow for a virtually real-time assessment of changes, while at the same time can be combined with other programmatic information to assist in planning, implementation, and modification/adjustment of malaria control activities to improve program performance. Whereas the current tools are not particularly suitable for this purpose, serological measurement, based on antibody prevalence, has been proposed as an alternative approach. Although this works well in areas of stable, low-level transmission, the vaccine antigens evaluated track changes in transmission very slowly and are thus of limited use in a rapidly changing environment where timely and actionable information is required. Thus there is an urgent need to identify a novel category of antigens with relatively short half-lives (6-8 weeks), and limited memory, for use in surveillance activitie. This need is particularly urgent for P. vivax, because well- characterized P. vivax candidate antigens are severely lacking. This study proposes to identify P. vivax proteins that can be used as antigens to screen for short half-life immune response, informing the recent history of parasite infection. Using multiplex bead assays, over 1,000 P. vivax proteins, produced by cell-free systems, will be screened against human plasma collected at different time intervals from P. vivax-infected subjects during clinical episodes and populations at risk in malaria endemic areas under a cohort epidemiological study with well-defined duration of new infection and post-treatment parasite clearance. The full kinetics profiles for antibodies to 100 selected antigens will be determined though analyzing the antibody titers at all time-points, to determine antibody half-lives. The 20 antigens with the best kinetic profiles (limited post-treatment antibody production, antibody half-life of 6-8 weeks, limited individual variation) will be selected for furher validation for use as surveillance candidate antigen to identify transmission hot-spots, using plasma from school-aged children in malaria-endemic and non-endemic areas. This study will result in the development of a novel serological assay to identify P. vivax transmission and its utility for detecting (residual) transmission 'hot-spots' among populations, and recent infections.\",\n",
       " 'Elucidation of the events responsible for HIV-1 and SIV mucosal transmission in the vagina, cervix and rectum, including a precise definition of virus - host cell - innate/adaptive immune interactions that precede the establishment of viremia and viral latency, could be instrumental in the design and development of effective vaccines. In recent years, our laboratories have taken significant strides toward addressing these objectives by developing a theoretical and experimental framework with which to identify transmitted/founder HIV-1 and SIV genomes responsible for virus transmission, and in parallel, developing in situ hybridization and quantitative PCR methods for detecting HIV-1 and SIV sequences in relevant mucosal and lymphoreticular tissues. However, these complementary molecular assays have not previously been used together in a systematic manner to analyze SIV transmission. Virology Core D will, for the first time, combine these technologically advanced approaches to study mucosal infections by SIVmac251, SIVmac239 and SHIV{SF162P3} with and without vaccine intervention in support of Projects 1-5. The overall objective of the Virology Core is thus to provide state-of-the-art molecular tools, experience and service to consortium investigators that will enable a spatial, temporal, genetic and immunocytohistological understanding of mucosal SIV transmission and subsequent virus dissemination in naive animals and to define sites and mechanisms of interception of this process in animals that are actively or passively vaccinated using different vaccine modalities. Specific aims are: (i) to provide support to the five projects for quantitative analysis of viral RNA and DNA using regular and ultra-sensitive nested qRT-PCR and PCR methods applied to cell-free and cell-associated blood, biopsy and necropsy specimens; (ii) to provide advanced sequencing approaches including single genome amplification (SGA) - direct amplicon sequencing and next generation Life Technologies 454 pyrosequencing and Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing to assess transmission bottlenecks and post-transmission viral spread and evolution; and (iii) to provide in situ hybridization-laser capture microdissection and SGA sequencing for recovery and analysis of viral sequences from infected cells and cell foci, especially at early times after inoculation, in order to assess spatiotemporal patterns of early virus amplification and spread. The results will provide novel insight into pathways and mechanisms of SIV transmission and vaccine prevention.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 infected individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) are living longer than the pre-cART era, however these individuals are at an increased risk of developing neurocognitive disorders referred to as HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). HIV-1 infects a great number of cells, yielding proviral DNA. And while cART reduces viral replication, it has no effect on these early viral gene products such as transactivator of transcription (Tat). Tat upregulates inflammatory mediators, stimulating peripheral monocytes to permeate into the central nervous system (CNS). The underlying mechanisms as to how monocytes are able to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) remain elusive. Previously, our lab has shown that in HAND patients, their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma contained abnormally high levels of soluble CD40L (sCD40L) and we have shown that mice injected with physiologically relevant concentrations of Tat had significantly greater levels of sCD40L in their plasma than non-treated mice. In addition, our lab has reported that CD40L receptor, CD40, were present on brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVEC) and thus this interaction promoted the infiltration of monocytes across the BBB, in vitro. Further, ourin vivo studies revealed that Tat induces BBB permeability in mice in a CD40L dependent manner as a result of atypical activation of platelets, a major source of sCD40L, because BBB permeability is reversed after platelet depletion. Overall, these data provide me with a rational framework to test my hypothesis that the virally encoded proteins induce CD40-CD40L signaling to disrupt neurovascular homeostasis and thereby compromising BBB integrity, yielding subsequent neurologic damages that are consistent with the CNS manifestations associated with HAND. The development of new therapeutic approaches can be expected at the completion of this study to address HAND and possibly other neurocognitive disorders not HAND related.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The virus population bottleneck to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission in injection drug users (IDUs) remains an understudied and controversial area of research with substantial potential relevance to prevention efforts, including vaccine design and assessment. Single genome sequencing (SGS) represents a powerful strategy for identifying and characterizing viruses that are responsible for establishing productive clinical infection (termed transmitted/founder, or T/F,viruses). Scientists have only recently begun to apply this approach to HIV and HCV transmission in IDUs; there are just two small studies enumerating HIV-1 T/F viruses in IDU subjects with conflicting conclusions, and a single study of HCV transmission in plasma donors where IDU were technically excluded. Importantly, these HIV-1 and HCV cohorts had neither longitudinal sampling nor comprehensive behavioral data available, which are critical in IDUs to distinguish between sexual and injection-related virus acquisition. In this application, we propose to combine novel quantitative and qualitative analyses of the HIV-1 and HCV T/F viruses responsible for productive clinical infection with a detailed assessment of injection and sexual transmission risk behaviors in a robust and clinically well-defined study population of 52 HIV-1 seroconversions and 71 HCV seroconversions from two recent HIV Prevention Trials Unit studies in Xinjiang, China. This application tests the hypothesis that IDU transmission is governed by quantifiable behavioral risks that determine the rates of virus acquisition, the multiplicity of virus infection, the virus phenotype and clinical outcomes of HIV and HCV infection. We will address this hypothesis by (i) identifying and enumerating the T/F HIV-1 and HCV viruses from the Xinjiang IDUs with acute HIV-1 and HCV infection, (ii) inferring the mode of transmission (sexual vs. injection) and determining the behavioral correlates of HIV-1 and HCV acquisition and multiple virus transmission, (iii) assessing the role of multiplicity of virus infection on HIV and HCV clinical outcomes, and (iv) molecularly cloning and determining the biologic phenotype of T/F HIV-1 Envs and the replication competence of HCV full-length genomes from this cohort of Chinese IDUs. Accurate characterization of the HIV and HCV transmission bottleneck in IDUs and its role in clinical disease progression will provide key information relevant to HIV-1 and HCV transmission, natural history and prevention, and in addition, will provide essential virologic data and molecular reagents for vaccine research focused on HIV-1 and HCV strains relevant to China, Southeast and Central Asia.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemiologic studies demonstrate that DMPA may increase the risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. Additionally, Depo-Provera has been shown to attenuate the vaccine efficacy to protect rhesus macaques against SIV infection. The impact of hormonal contraceptive use on HIV acquisition and transmission has profound implications for polices on family planning, particularly in countries with high rates of HIV transmission. While progesterone clearly enhances vaginal transmission of SIV/SHIV in rhesus macaques, the effect of progestin-based hormone on HIV acquisition/transmission in women remains unresolved. We hypothesize that injectable DMPA alters immune responses and cervicovaginal and colonic microbiomes, which may lead to increased HIV acquisition and transmission. The aims of this proposal are designed to (1) determine the impact of Depo-Provera on the systemic and mucosal immune systems and on cervicovaginal and colonic microbiomes in a longitudinal study, and (2) to elucidate the immune mechanisms of MPA-mediated modulation of HIV infection/transmission in vitro, ex vivo and in cervical explant models. Blood, cervicovaginal specimens and stool samples will be collected at baseline (both follicular and luteal phases) and after 4, and 8 weeks of DMPA injection. The immunological profiles of CD4+ T cells and their susceptibility to HIV will be characterized. We will determine the temporal impact of DMPA on cervicovaginal and colonic microbiome. Global alteration and changes in specific taxa will be correlated with immunological changes. The results of our studies will provide a better understanding of how DMPA modulates immunologic responses and microbiomes, thereby informing the design of effective HIV prevention strategies.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the search for a vaccine and a cure for HIV-1 are ongoing, new prevention strategies are needed. Two possibilities are microbicides and pre-exposure prophylaxis. Both have shown only partial efficacy in clinical trials. The basis for theseresults, in particular for the CAPRISA 004 trial, are uncertain but likely include poor adherence. Based on our recent results, one additional possibility could be a lack of protection from cell-associated transmission. Specifically, vaginal exposure of humanized mice with HIV-1 infected cells resulted in successful infection of 9/10 mice. Having established this cell-associated HIV-1 transmission model, we next replicated the CAPRISA 004 experimental approach and determined if vaginal administration of anti-HIV drug tenofovir inhibits cell-associated HIV-1 infection. Surprisingly, we found tenofovir treatment resulted in only 33% protection against cell-associated HIV-1. This highly contrasts with our observation with cell-free HIV-1 which demonstrated 88% protection with tenofovir. These striking results have significant implications for the development of preventative approaches since they suggest that methods that effectively prevent cell-free HIV-1 transmission may not prevent cell-associated HIV-1 transmission. Therefore, it is of great importance to implement and validate in vivo models of cell-associated HIV-1 transmission that can be used to identify drug strategies that are effective at preventing both modes of HIV-1 infection. Based on this compelling preliminary data, the fundamental hypothesis that will be tested is that cell-associated HIV-1 transmission is more efficient than cell-free virus and is less susceptible to microbicides due to the ability to migrate away from thevaginal vault. This hypothesis will be tested by determining the relative efficacy of transmission by cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1. Microbicides using different anti-viral drugs that target different steps of the HIV-1 life cycle will also be evaluated for the ability to prevent cell-associated HIV-1 transmission. Finally, we will evaluate pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) based strategies for their ability to determine if they can block cell-associated HIV as well. By determining which drugs and administration methods are effective, we can gain insight on the potential mechanisms of cell-associated HIV-1 transmission. The results of these studies will likely influence the future design of HIV-1 prevention strategies.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in infants and young children associate with 25-80% greater subsequent rates of recurrent wheezing, airways hyperreactivity (AHR) and asthma compared to same age children not experiencing severe RSV LRTIs. Some of these severe RSV LRTIs may identify those infants genetically predisposed to develop asthma at older age, but epidemiological studies and animal models suggest that severe RSV LRTIs may also specifically contribute to asthma inception. In fact, enough evidence exists today to consider a potential role for protective RSV vaccines in decreasing pediatric asthma rates by preventing severe RSV LRTI. Interestingly, and in line with the overwhelming evidence supporting the Hygiene Hypothesis, upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) during infancy have been shown to decrease the rates of pediatric asthma and AHR. Moreover, epidemiological data, studies in animal models, and preliminary data from our laboratory support the hypothesis that a rationally designed live attenuated intranasal (IN) RSV vaccine (mimicking an RSV URTI) may contribute to modulate the development of immunity in the host and prevent asthma inception. Data from others and our laboratory show that RSV and its main protective antigen, the fusion (F) protein, can elicit a long-lived natural T regulatory (nTreg) lymphocyte response, presumably through Myd88-dependent activation, negatively modulating asthma inception. In addition, animal and human data from our laboratory demonstrate that RSV can downregulate TLR4 expression in the respiratory tract. TLR4 expression in the respiratory epithelium is critical for the inception f asthma in the classic house dust mite (HDM) model of disease. Therefore, if all these observations - which we propose to study- are confirmed, rationale design of an RSV vaccine considering the aforementioned effects, may change the landscape of pediatric asthma by: I) protecting against the pro-asthmatic effects of RSV LRTI, and 2)  maturing  host immunity. Understanding the protective effects of RSV vaccines and the virus glycoproteins against the inception of asthma, and their mechanisms of risk modulation, can lead to the rationale design of a pediatric vaccine working simultaneously against two critical pediatric diseases. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Determine whether intranasal immunization using RSV surface glycoproteins F and G modulates the inception of asthma. Aim 2. Determine whether RSV F vaccines decrease inception of asthma by expanding nTregs through Tlr2 activation and downregulation of Tlr4 expression in respiratory epithelium. Aim 3. Determine whether IN immunization with cptsRSV248-404 prevents the inception of asthma.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many AIDS patients can now expect to live a long life because highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) effectively suppress HIV replication to undetectable levels. However, chemotherapy is associated with severe side effects that affect long-term health, is very expensive, and as such interferes with adherence by patients. Therefore, there is a continued need to develop and optimize therapy regimens to lessen side effects, promote better adherence, and increase the relative drug efficacy. The Baltimore and the Trkola laboratories have recently questioned the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies and neutralizing antibodies during HIV cell-to-cell transmission. Cell-to-cell transmission allows efficient viral spreading via sites of cell-cell contact designated virological synapses. Importanty, it increases the number of proviruses in infected target cells thereby leading to higher viral geneexpression as compared to infections by cell-free HIV. The higher effective local MOI leads to a high multiplicity of infection that can result in the increased resistance of cell-to-cell transmision to antiviral therapies. These recent observations require a re-evaluation of commonly used antiretroviral therapies against HIV cell-to-cell transmission. Here we propose to systematically test the effectiveness of numerous antiretroviral inhibitors against HIV cell-to-cell transmission.We hypothesize that the observed resistance to anti-retroviral drugs depends on the inhibitory potential of the drug. Drugs with high inhibitory potential may be the most effective against cell-to-cell transmission of HIV. We will apply a highly sensitive and quantitative assay that measures HIV cell- to-cell transmission as a necessary first step to re-evaluate the efficacy of commonly used antiretroviral inhibitors. Our experiments have the potential to further optimize existing HAART regimens.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION: Mucosal surfaces play multiple roles in the transmission and pathogenesis of HIV-1. Transmission of HIV-1 occurs primarily across rectal and reproductive tract mucosal surfaces and the local microenvironment is known to affect the success of transmission. In addition, intestinal tissues are key compartments in which there is early and sustained loss of CD4+ T helper cells. As with all lymphoid tissues, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is highly dynamic with immune cells trafficking in and out of the tissue parenchyma. This movement of cells is driven in large part by chemokines. As critical components of the mucosal immune system, chemokines play multiple direct and indirect roles in the transmission of HIV-1 and the related simian virus, SIV, as well as subsequent pathogenesis. We will address the roles of chemokines and inflammation in SIV transmission and control of viral replication in the studies proposed here and are uniquely poised to intervene to augment or neutralize mucosal chemokines in vivo. With regard to the transmission of SIV, CCL20 has been linked to inflammatory milieus that facilitate SIV mucosal transmission, consistent with its proinflammatory properties. CCL20 also has direct anti-HIV properties and stimulates the viral restriction factor APOBEC3G. Further it is a critical homing signal for mucosal Th17 cells, which are lost during SIV infection. In these studies we will explore the mucosally-expressed subset of chemokines in the transmission and pathogenesis of SIV, focusing on CCL20. We are uniquely poised with simianized mAb that neutralizes CCL20, and a depth of understanding of chemokine expression and function, to determine the role that CCL20 and other chemokines play in SIV transmission and pathogenesis. Our overall hypothesis is that inhibition of chemokine-driven inflammation will reduce SIV transmission and pathogenesis. To address this hypothesis, our Specific Aims are to: (1) Determine the role of CCL20 in SIV mucosal transmission and viral control; (2) Define the mechanisms of action of anti-chemokine therapy via identification of its effects on macaque tissues; and (3) Identify new functional and expression control aspects of CCL20 biology.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The matrix (M) protein is the major viral structural protein that regulates assembly and structure determination in members of the Para- and Ortho-myxoviridae families. The two families include numerous human pathogens such as human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), measles virus (MeV), human parainfluenza virus (hPIV), and the Influenza A, B, and C genera. The matrix protein initiates virus assembly by forming oligomeric sheets in specific regions along the host cell membrane. The M protein also orchestrates the incorporation of the viral glycoproteins and the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) into the evolving viral particles. Here we aim to determine two things: 1) the native structure and organization of RSV, which is an archetypical member of the Paramyxoviridae family; and 2) how the RSV M protein regulates virus assembly and determines virus morphology. To answer these questions, we are using the A2 strain of RSV that causes bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia, and death in young children, the elderly, and immuno-compromised individuals. We are analyzing RSV structure to build upon our previous structural studies of HIV-1 assembly and maturation, our ongoing structural analysis of native measles virus glycoprotein arrangements and interactions, and to develop RSV as a model system for future structural studies of virus assembly, virus organization, and the development of correlative microscopy methods. Together these studies will provide new information regarding the pleiomorphic structure of native RSV virions and the structural and functional role of the matrix protein in myxovirus assembly and morphology regulation. The two areas to be investigated in this project are: 1. Determine the native structure of RSV strain A2. Experiments will determine the natural structure of RSV through cryo-ET of frozen hydrated virions. Cryo-immuno-EM approaches and RSV RNA-specific probes will be used to define the placement and organizational patterns of the RSV structural proteins, F, G, SH, M, and the RNP complex during cryo-ET analysis of cryo-preserved virions. 2. Determine the structure of oligomeric RSV M in vivo and under in vitro assembly conditions. Experiments in this aim will determine the in vivo structure of RSV M in native virions and virus like particles (VLPs) through cryo-ET and sub-tomogram averaging. Cryo-ET, cryo-EM and helical reconstruction approaches will define the high-resolution structure of RSV M under in vitro assembly conditions.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is my goal to become an independent investigator studying the epidemiology of bacterial infections and the role of bacterial genetic diversity in transmission, pathogenesis, and disease outcome. I envision that my research program will have three interconnected arms: epidemiologic studies involving collection of bacterial samples, investigation of genetic diversity of the bacterial samples and its association with clinical and epidemiological characteristics, and study of the functional impact of the observed genetic diversity. I have gained experience in conducting studies of bacterial genetic diversity and its clinical, epidemiological, and functional relevance through my doctoral work and my post-doctoral training so far. However, I have not yet had any experience in conducting epidemiologic studies that involve collecting bacterial samples and participant data and consider this a major gap in my training and ability to attain my career goals. To fill this gap in my training, I have crafted a research proposal that will allow me to obtain important experience in the design of an epidemiologic study, recruitment of study participants, and collection of biological specimens and subject data under the supervision and guidance of mentors who have extensive experience in conducting these types of studies.  The career development plan takes advantage of the variety of expertise among faculty members at The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), an institution that fosters interdisciplinary research. The proposed research, which integrates epidemiology and molecular biology, will be supervised by a mentoring committee that includes a molecular and cell biologist and H. pylori expert (Dr. Nina Salama, mentor), two epidemiologists (Dr. Johanna Lampe, co-mentor, and Dr. Thomas Vaughan), and a biostatistician (Dr. Sarah Holte). I will meet with my mentor weekly and with my co-mentor at least twice monthly to discuss details of the research study. Twice yearly, I will meet with my entire mentoring committee to present my research progress and discuss future steps for my research and career development. In addition to support from my mentoring committee members, I will take advantage of both the scientific and career development seminars held at FHCRC and the University of Washington.  The proposed research is a study of H. pylori transmission within families and the bacterial genetic changes that occur during adaptation to a new host. H. pylori transmission predominantly occurs within families, but it is not known if this is attributable to the sustained close contacts between family members or because the genetic relatedness of the family members facilitates transmission. Bacterial adaptations to the individual host that occur during H. pylori's decades-long infection may cause the strain to be better able to colonize a genetically similar host. H. pylori has many mechanisms for genetic diversification, which likely aids the bacterium in adapting to the newly infected host after transmission. Diversification of genes that encode H. pylori cell surface structures that interact with the host is especially likely to be important during adaptation to a new host. In this grant,  test the hypothesis that H. pylori transmission predominantly occurs within families because an H. pylori strain that is adapted to the individual host is better able to colonize a genetically similar host. Furthermore, I test the hypothesis that H. pylori will undergo more genetic diversification when being transmitted between unrelated individuals than between related individuals. Aim 1 proposes to collect stool samples from members of families with biological children and families with adopted children, genotype H. pylori from the stool DNA, and compare the extent of H. pylori genotype sharing, which indicates transmission, between the two different types of families using statistical analysis. In Aim 2, H. pylori DNA isolated from family members who share the same H. pylori strain will be compared by PCR and DNA sequencing to look for genetic changes to genes involved in bacterial-host interactions that would affect expression or function of the encoded protein. The extent of genetic changes within H. pylori strain pairs shared by related and unrelated family members will then be examined. The proposed research will result in important information about the patterns of H. pylori transmission within families and the contribution of shared host genetics versus household contact to transmission. Further knowledge of the factors involved in H. pylori transmission will inform strategies for preventing and treating new infections. The proposed research will also result in an improved understanding of the genetic diversification and adaptation of H. pylori to anew host, allowing the bacteria to maintain an active, persistent infection in the face of host defenses and eventually cause ulcers and stomach cancer.\",\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HCV is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in China, with an estimated per capita prevalence that is three-fold that of the United States. Although there are limited data, HCV incidence is also thought to be increasing. However, the contribution of unsafe sex to ongoing HCV transmission among high-risk groups such as MSM (men who have sex with men) is not well understood. Meanwhile, China's estimated three to 18 million MSM exhibit very high HIV incidence and prevalence rates. The number of HIV-positive Chinese MSM is expected to increase due to high rates of unprotected anal intercourse and the high incidence of HIV infection. Most studies on HCV in China examine parenteral causes of transmission such as intravenous drug use (IDU), plasma blood donation, or medical treatment-related infections, and have not focused on sexual transmission of HCV. Recent studies in Western countries have shown an epidemic of HCV infection among MSM that is unrelated to parenteral spread. Studies suggest sexual transmission of HCV, especially among HIV-infected MSM, due to rectal co-infections and/or rough sex leading to mucosal breakdown. There are also respondent driven sampling data from MSM in China suggesting a high rate of intimate partner violence, which may also contribute to homosexual HCV transmission. By exploring the HCV status of partners of established HIV-infected MSM, we aim to study the contribution that sexual activity plays in HCV transmission. Therefore, using a mixed-method design with a known clinical population (i.e., HIV-positive Chinese MSM), we propose to (1) establish the differential and joint contribution of sexual risks (e.g., unprotected, receptive anal intercourse)and IDU to HCV transmission among HIV-infected Chinese MSM and their IDU and sexual partners; (2) establish the molecular epidemiology of HCV and HIV (via genotyping and phylogenetic analysis); describe and examine biosocial correlates (e.g., viral load; multiple sexual partners; sexual risks; multiple drug-using partners, cross-generational drug use) associated with lack of transmission via these two routes; (4) describe and examine behavioral and social network characteristics (egocentric) associated with sexual and/or drug risk determinants of HCV; and (5) model expected HCV-HIV morbidity based on these findings. Our study has high public health significance because, with the recent advent of new therapies for chronic HCV treatment (such as direct-acting agents), HCV has become a highly treatable disease yet many infected persons remain unaware of their condition. The study is innovative in that it delves more deeply into specific routes of sexual transmission, whereas many previous studies classified all sexual partners without distinction. The integration of behavioral network analysis and HCV and HIV phylogenetic analysis provides enhanced evidence for developing tailored prevention strategies for HCV-HIV co-infected MSM.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this career development award is for Dr. Philip A. Chan to acquire the training and experience necessary to become an independent clinical investigator. The career goals of this proposal are to gain expertise in the field of HIV-oriented molecular epidemiology including familiarity with biostatistics and study design, to become skilled using molecular phylogenetics to study HIV transmission patterns and population dynamics, to acquire experience in HIV behavior and prevention sciences, and to receive proper training in the Responsible Conduct of Research including ethical practices. The number of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected individuals continues to increase in the United States, propagated by transmission in social networks among high-risk groups. Identification of networks within which HIV transmission occurs can lead to targeted screening and effective prevention interventions. Current HIV epidemiologic contact tracing programs implemented by public health departments are often limited by reporting and recall bias secondary to the lag time between infection and diagnosis as well as the reluctance of HIV-infected individuals to report partners. This research proposal integrates molecular epidemiology and public health programs to identify transmission networks and develop behavior assessment and intervention tools. In collaboration with other major academic centers in Rhode Island and the Department of Health, molecular epidemiology will be used to enhance contact tracing programs and develop future targeted prevention strategies. The objectives of the research are to: 1) Identify transmission networks among HIV- infected individuals using molecular phylogenetic approaches; 2) Determine risk factors and characteristics associated with transmission networks that may be targeted for interventions; and 3) Identify contacts of individuals forming transmission networks to diagnose HIV-infected yet unaware cases, characterize risk behaviors, and assess acceptability of novel prevention interventions. This research will allow a comprehensive investigation of HIV epidemiology and development of an effective public health model that can be implemented elsewhere. During the course of this award, Dr. Chan will be mentored by experts from Brown University in the field of molecular genetics and HIV epidemiology including Dr. Rami Kantor (primary mentor) and Dr. Kenneth Mayer.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to assess the feasibility of using recombinant virus-like- particles (VLPs) to elicit neutralizing antibodies andprime CD4+ T cells reactive with hepatitis B viral (HBV) antigens as candidate immunotherapeutics for chronic HBV infection. For this purpose, we have defined 8 neutralizing B cell epitopes from the HBV envelope Pre-S1 region, which will be consolidated and inserted onto a species variant of the HBV core protein, namely the woodchuck hepatitis core antigen(WHcAg). Pre-S1 B cell epitopes were chosen because of their preferential expression on HBV virions. The WHO estimates that more than 360 million individuals are chronically infected with HBV and approximately 20- 40% will develop serious complication such as cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although a safe and efficacious preventative vaccine for HBV has been available for over 20years, HBV infections continue (with more than 50 million HBV infections per year) to be a major health problem and no effective treatments for chronic infection exist. Antiviral drugs have improved the therapeutic options for chronic HBV, but, their efficacy remains limited due to reactivation of HBV replicationupon drug withdrawal. Vaccine-based immunotherapy has been suggested as a possible monotherapy or as a combination therapy with antiviral drugs. However, immune tolerance has prevented therapeutic vaccine efficacy. To circumvent the obstacle of immune tolerance in HBV chronic carriers, we have chosen the WHcAg, which is approximately 66-68% homologous with the HBcAg, as a vaccine carrier. The WHcAg and the HBcAg are not crossreactive at the B cell level and, just as importantly for our purposes, are only partially crossreactive at the CD4+ T cel level. Therefore, CD4+ T cells specific for WHcAg-unique T cell sites will provide cognate T-B cell help for anti- PreS1 antibody production and will not be curtailed by immune tolerance. In fact, in preliminary studies in HBcAg-Tg mice, which are tolerant to HBcAg, immunization with hybrid WHcAg- PreS1 VLPs elicits equivalent high titer anti- PreS1 antibodies in wildtype and HBcAg-Tg mice. Specifically, in Aim 1 we propose to consolidate 8 HBsAg-PreS1 neutralizing B cell epitopes onto the WHcAg VLP carrier and optimize the constructs based on assembly, yield, stability and immunogenicity and the therapeutic efficacy of the VLP-based vaccine candidates will be evaluated in a transgenic (Tg) mouse model of HBV replication. In Aim 2 preclinical development of the WHcAg-PreS1 vaccine will be pursued including cGMP manufacturing and pharm/tox studies.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the inefficiency of HIV transmission and the availability of methods to prevent HIV transmission, 2.6 million individuals acquire HIV infectionsevery year. Although the CAPRISA Phase III trial found that tenofovir microbicide decreased HIV infection in women, the follow-up VOICE Phase III trial of the same microbicide gel failed to demonstrate any protection. Thus, in order to develop consistently effective interventions that can prevent HIV acquisition a more detailed understanding of the biology of HIV transmission populations most at risk for infection. The presence or absence of genital inflammation is of fundamental importance since and epidemiologic studies suggest that the risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection is increased in women with cervicovaginal inflammation induced by sexually transmitted infections especially HSV-2. However, despite the epidemiologic associations and supporting circumstantial evidence, it is not possible to directly determine the effects of genitalinflammation on HIV transmission in humans. This project will use a non-human primate (NHP) model to provide a detailed understanding of the role of HSV2 induced genital inflammation in HIV transmission and dissemination after vaginal exposure. We have defined the target cells and dissemination pathways and the number and nature of founder SIV variants after vaginal SIVmac251 exposure. However, all these studies have been conducted with mature macaques chosen without regard to levels of pre-existing genital inflammation. Inflammation may affect critical parameters in HIV transmission and pathogenesis that, in turn can alter the ability of a vaccine or microbicide to prevent HIV transmission. These parameters include the dose of HIV required to infect an individual and the rate of HIV dissemination from the genital tract to systemic tissues. Once the virology of vaginal SIV transmission in the setting of genital inflammation is characterized, then this NHP model will be useful for testing candidate vaccines and microbicides designed to prevent HIV transmission. Moreover, in this proposal we will develop and test the hypothesis that combining antimicrobial therapy and topical anti-inflammatory agents will reduce the effect of genital inflammation on transmission.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis B (HBV) coinfection in HIV is common in resource-limited settings and is a leading cause of mortality. Infant immunoprophylaxis to prevent perinatal HBV transmission is often unavailable in resource- limited settings endemic for HIV and HBV, including those in Africa. As in HIV, antiviral therapy can be effective in the prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) of HBV. However, there are potentially unintended consequences of single agent antiviral drug exposure for PMTCT. In HIV, when single agent nevirapine is used for PMTCT, HIV resistance commonly occurs and is associated with HIV treatment failure in infants and mothers. Similarly, the use of single agent lamivudine, an antiviral with both HIV and HBV activity, results in high rates of HBV resistance and a vaccine escape phenotype. Despite the widespread use of lamivudine in WHO-recommended HIV PMTCT regimens in areas endemic for HBV, it is unknown how lamivudine will impact HBV perinatal transmission and HBV drug resistance in HIV coinfection. The long-term goal of this research program is to identify the optimal prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) regimen in HIV/HBV coinfected pregnant women. The objective here is to determine how lamivudine-containing PMTCT regimens impact HBV transmission. The central hypothesis is that lamivudine will reduce HBV perinatal transmission but result in maternal and infant HBV drug resistance and HBV vaccine escape mutations. Maternal minor populations of drug resistance may also be important in the transmission of resistance. The rationale is that if HBV drug resistance is common after lamivudine- containing PMTCT therapies, then regimens with higher HBV potency will be required. This central hypothesis will be tested using the serum repository of HPTN 046, an HIV PMTCT trial of extended infant nevirapine prophylaxis in 1522 mother-infant pairs in Africa. We will pursue three specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of lamivudine in the prevention of HBV perinatal transmission in HIV/HBV coinfected pregnant women, 2) Identify the predictors of perinatal HBV transmission and 3) Determine the impact of lamivudine on maternal and infant HBV drug resistance and vaccine escape phenotypes. Under the first two aims, the incidence and predictors of perinatal HBV transmission in HIV coinfection, including the role of antepartum lamivudine, will be determined. Under the third aim, the impact of lamivudine exposure on maternal and infant drug resistance will be examined. Using a novel minority variant assay developed by the applicant, the role of HBV minority variants as predictors of transmission will also be examined. The approach is innovative because it will change how HBV PMTCT regimens are selected and because it will utilize a novel minority variant detection assay that has several advantages over currently available techniques. The proposed research is significant because it will be the first step in defining the optimal PMTCT regimen in HIV/HBV coinfected women. Ultimately, such knowledge will inform global HBV public health prevention strategies.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION: Oral HIV breastfeeding transmission (BFT) accounts for more than half of the cases of maternal-to-infant HIV transmission (MTIT). In spite of being a priority of HIV-1 research, prevention of oral HIV BFT is difficult to achieve because its mechanisms are not fully understood. Maternal virological and immunological parameters of infection, as well as innate immune factors present in milk, have been associated with oral HIV BFT. These associations are not always evident [i.e., transmission occurs from mothers with low viral loads (VLs) and vice versa, a large proportion of infants remain uninfected in spite of a long-term continuous exposure to high levels of maternal virus], pointing to the involvement of additional factors in transmission.  Our preliminary studies showed that in African nonhuman primate (NHP) hosts of SIV: (i) MTIT is virtually nonexistent (<5%) (lower than the levels targeted by the WHO as a goal for achieving  virtual elimination  of HIV-1 MTIT); (ii) low MTIT contrasts with massive offspring SIV exposure both in utero and through BFT due to the high SIV prevalence (>80%) and high acute and chronic VLs in dams; (iii) resistance to SIV BFT is strongly associated with low levels of SIV target cells at mucosal sites of the offspring; (iv) susceptibility to experimental mucosal transmission is proportional to the availability of mucosal CCR5+ CD4+ T cells. Based on these observations, our hypothesis is that the levels of HIV/SIV target cells at the mucosal sites of thebreastfed infant drive the efficacy of HIV BFT.  To confirm our hypothesis, we identified two NHP models of HIV infection which differ in susceptibility to SIV BFT: (1) SIVmac-infected rhesus macaques (RMs) will serve as a model of effective oral SIV BFT and (2) SIVagm-infected African green monkeys (AGMs) as a model of resistance to oral SIV BFT. By comparing and contrasting these two animal models, we will investigate the mechanism of oral HIV/SIV BFT and explore new strategies to prevent oral HIV transmission.  In addition to the use of two animal models in which exposure to breast milk has an opposite outcome, we developed: (1) a new challenge strategy consisting of dose escalation, which we demonstrated in a preliminary study to accurately model natural mucosal transmission, while efficiently infecting the animals; (2) new challenge tools, consisting of transmitted/founder infectious molecular clones (IMCs) that permit us to physiologically model SIV transmission and molecularly tagged IMCs of SIVmac and SIVagm which offer us the advantages of IMCs combined with the possibility to monitor the bottleneck of transmission; (3) a new assay for monitoring virus transmission and the diversity of the transmitted virus (real-time single genome amplification). In a step-wise approach, we will achieve the following Specific aims (SA):     SA1. To test the hypothesis that the infant mucosa drives the efficacy of SIV BFT.     SA1a. Dissect the relative contribution of milk vs. the levels of infant mucosal target cells in driving   HIV-1 BFT.      SA1b. Provide proof-of-concept data that reduction of target cell availability in the infant mucosa   decreases SIV BFT rates.     SA2. To identify the mucosal site of viral entry upon oral HIV/SIV BFT and to assess early mucosal changes that are associated with SIV BFT.      SA2a. Perform  virological dissections  of the potential sites of entry.      SA2b. Identify the exact site of SIV entry upon oral exposure through breastfeeding and the mucosal factors associated with oral SIV transmission.     Relevance. Combined, these studies carried out in NHP species that vary in their susceptibility to SIV BFT, employing innovative interventions and new analytical tools, will delineate the factors responsible for oral SIV BFT and identify new strategies for preventing oral HIV transmission.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Innate antiviral immunity comprises a host defense mechanism for restricting virus spread. The host cells recognizes invading viruses by specialized receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that can specifically identify pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG like helicase (RLH) receptors (e.g. RIGI and Mda5) are known to recognize virus specific PAMPs for induction of antiviral response mediated by activation of the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3). IRF3 activation results in production of antiviral cytokine interferon-a/¿ (IFN). Recently we identified nucleotide- binding oligomerization domain-2 (NOD2) protein, belonging to the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and leucine-rich-region (LRR) containing family (known as NLRs) of cytoplasmic receptors as a viral PRR. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated that NOD2 can trigger an antiviral response (via activation of IRF3/IFN) following infection with human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV possess single stranded RNA or ssRNA as its genome), the major etiological viral agent causing worldwide pulmonary infections among infants, children and elderly. Therefore the current proposal is aimed at - a) establishing NOD2 as a new viral PRR, b) studying the mechanism of NOD2 activation, c) identifying and characterizing the molecules that act downstream of activated NOD2, and d) investigating the in vivo role of NOD2 during RSV pathogenesis, RSV induced lung inflammation and development of lung disease. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that expression of NOD2 in RSV infected cells results in activation of IRF3/IFN. Further studies revealed that - a) NOD2 can recognize ssRNA to activate IRF3/IFN, and b) mitochondrial outer membrane residing protein IPS-1 (MAVS) may act downstream of NOD2 for activation of IRF3/IFN . Thus, we hypothesize that NOD2 is a new member of viral PRR that can recognize viral ssRNA genome to launch an antiviral response following activation of mitochondrial IPS-1 protein. The hypothesis will be tested by focusing on the following specific aims: Aim # 1. Study the role of NOD2 during antiviral response against RSV - The major question of this aim is - Does NOD2 constitute a viral PRR that can activate IRF3/IFN in infected cells? We will investigate whether NOD2 is involved in IRF3/IFN activation during RSV infection of normal primary human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells. The physiological relevance of NOD2 during host defense against RSV pathogenesis and RSV mediated lung inflammation/disease will also be established by using NOD2 knock-out (KO) mice. Aim # 2. Study the mechanism of NOD2 activation - The major question of this aim is - a) Does NOD2 recognizes ssRNA and interacts with mitochondrial localized IPS-1 to activate IRF3/IFN? This question will be addressed by - a) studying association of NOD2 with ssRNA (RSV genome and synthetic ssRNA) and IPS-1, b) examining NOD2 mediated IRF3/IFN activation in cells lacking IPS-1, and c) identifying the specific NOD2 domain(s) involved in ssRNA recognition and IPS-1 interaction.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV continues to infect human populations worldwide, emphasizing the need for epidemiological tools that can accurately describe transmission patterns. Thus, the methods we will develop will have specific impact on HIV vaccines; evolution; epidemiological parameters: spread of infection in different groups; intervention; and more generally on the fundamental science of infectious diseases. The overall goal is to understand the relationship between virus evolution and its epidemiological history, and to create epidemiological tools that can make reliable contact tracings and assess changes in epidemic dynamics. We have recently shown that the epidemic rate is inversely correlated to the virus evolutionary rate on the population level. Thus, the specific hypothesis behind the proposed research is that there is a relationship between the speed at which an epidemic moves through a human population and the rate at which the virus evolves in that population. We have observed that there are discrepancies between transmission histories and viral phylogenies, and because the inferences of epidemics are based on phylogenetics, it becomes important to understand the limitations in such inferences. Based on this the specific aims of this proposal are to: 1. Create a model that accurately describes the connection between transmission history and viral phylogeny. Preliminary results suggest that there are  hidden lineages  in viral phylogenies that are involved in transmission events, potentially misleading reconstruction of transmission events. We will especially investigate the effects of the effective population size in the donor, the bottleneck at transmission, and incomplete lineage sorting during transmission and sampling. We aim to estimate meaningful confidence levels on reconstructed person-to-person transmissions enabling us to explore alternative hypotheses in a statistical framework specifically designed for epidemiological tracking. 2. Identify the mechanism that correlates epidemic rate and virus evolutionary rate. We will decipher the connection between epidemic rate and viral evolutionary rate. Currently, we have four alternative explanations that may cause the observed correlation between epidemic and evolutionary rate (host immune selection, viral generation time effects, selection during transmission, and recombination effects). We will use different gene sequence data, codon positions as well as amino acid signatures to discriminate between these hypothetical explanations. We will use large datasets to develop epidemiological models that include these four hypothetical explanations to investigate their effects on the population level, and also model social networks and epidemic and phylogeographic dynamics.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently discovered expression of the Non-Structural protein 2 of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is responsible for hallmark characteristics of RSV infection of human airway epithelium. Using recombinant Parainfluenza Virus (PIV) expressing RSV NS2 and relevant models of human and hamster columnar airway epithelium we show RSV NS2 has a dramatic effect on the fate of PIV-infected cells resulting in a striking shedding of virus-infected epithelial cells into the airway lumen and a hyper-inflammatory phenotype. In hamster distal airways, shedding cells accumulate in the narrow lumens causing acute distal airway obstruction accompanied by exaggerated recruitment of inflammatory cells. These histologic findings are remarkably similar to those found in airways of human infants with RSV bronchiolitis and suggest PIV- mediated RSV NS2 expression in hamster bronchioles represent a novel animal model for investigating early initiating events of bronchiolitis.  We are eager to use this model to test therapeutic approaches for reducing the severity of RSV bronchiolitis and envision strategies that lessen the consequences of RSV NS2 expression may provide therapeutic benefit to infants with RSV bronchiolitis.  Our first use of this model will be to explore a significant clinical question; why steroids fail to suppress RSV-induced inflammation while effectively suppressing inflammation induced by PIV? Using relevant models of columnar airway epithelium we test whether RSV NS2 expression renders PIV-induced inflammation resistant to steroids in vitro and in vivo. We also test the efficacy of anovel class of non-steroidal anti- inflammatory modulators, the synthetic triterpenoids, to suppress consequences of RSV NS2 expression as these drugs have shown great promise as anti-inflammatory agents but without the adverse effects of steroids and are currently in human clinical trials for non-respiratory indications. Our notion is RSV NS2-induced inflammation, while resistant to steroids, may be suppressed by triterpenoids.  Finally, to capitalize on the wealth ofmouse genetic models and related reagents we engineer mouse respiratory viruses to express RSV NS2 and test whether infection of mouse airways with these novel chimeric viruses results in distal airway obstruction and exaggerated airway inflammation; thus, providing a useful animal model for future mechanistic studies.  RSV bronchiolitis is the single largest cause of hospitalization of infants. Here, we develop animal models in which RSV NS2 expression in distal airways recapitulates hallmark characteristics of RSV bronchiolitis in infants. These studies will provide a novel platform for developing and testing therapeutics for relieving the onset and severity of RSV bronchiolitis in humans.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in veterans. MRSA is transmitted through direct or indirect contact in the healthcare setting. In acute care settings, we use Contact Precautions (health care workers [HCW] wear gowns and gloves for all patient contact) for patients colonized with MRSA to prevent transmission to other patients. Current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Isolation Guidelines suggest modifying Contact Precautions in long term care facilities (LTCF), but there is little evidence to guide how to modify them. The goal of this revised proposal is to determine the optimal modifications of Contact Precautions for LTCF in order reduce the risk of MRSA transmission and allow care in a home-like, patient-centered environment consistent the Community Living Centers Cultural Transformation. LTCFs provide multiple levels of care including rehabilitation, skilled nursing and maintenance care. In the PI's current VA Merit award, we demonstrated that MRSA transmission is four-fold higher in rehabilitation care than in other long term care. This suggests that the types of care delivered increase the risk of transmission. MRSA transmission to other residents is difficult to study. Recently we developed a novel surrogate measure of MRSA transmission, detection of MRSA on HCW gown and gloves during HCW-patient interaction. Using this new methodology, we will test two major hypotheses based on expert opinion recommendations from the CDC Isolation Guidelines. 1. Risk of MRSA transmission will vary by type of contact with the resident and each activity will have its own risk of transmission. Some activities such as those involving contact with secretions (e.g. draining wounds, ostomy care) will be of higher risk than others (e.g. vital signs, medication administration). 2. For any given type of contact, resident characteristics increases the risk of transmission (e.g. residents totally dependent upon healthcare personnel for healthcare and activities of daily living or residents whose secretions or drainage cannot be contained). Our aim is to estimate the frequency of and risk factors for MRSA transmission to protective gowns and gloves worn by HCW interacting with 400 MRSA colonized VA long term care residents in a multi-site observational study in VA Community Living Centers from four states and the District of Columbia.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Osteoporosis is a widely prevalent contributor to frailty, increased morbidity, and mortality in the elderly and results from an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. Sirtuins have been implicated in metabolism, longevity, and healthspan. Resveratrol (RSV) is a sirtuin activating compound that enhances bone mineral density (BMD) in mice, and sirtuin knockout mice exhibit increased osteoclastogenesis. SRT2183 and SRT1720 are synthetic resveratrol mimetics (SyRMs) that were designed to specifically activate sirtuin1 (Sirt1), but an increasing number of reports suggest that RSV and SyRMs act on targets other than Sirt1. Our preliminary data demonstrate that: 1) SyRMs inhibit c-Src phosphorylation, actin ring formation, osteoclast formation, and bone resorption, but RSV does not; 2) SyRMs also disrupt actin rings and inhibit bone resorption in mature osteoclasts, but RSV does not; 3) knockout of Sirt1 expression impairs bone quality in vivo and enhances osteoclastogenesis ex vivo, but SyRMs still inhibit actin ring and osteoclast formation in Sirt1 knockout cells; 4) RSV treatment of young mice increases osteoblastogenesis and decreases osteoclastogenesis; and 5) RSV treatment of very old mice markedly improves bone mass and bone quality. Hypothesis and Specific Aims:  We hypothesize that SyRMs inhibit critical pathways of osteoclast formation and function involving c-Src phosphorylation, Rho GTPase activation, and NFATc1 expression. Intriguingly, despite lack of effect in vitro, RSV exerts pronounced benefit in vivo, suggesting that the predominant effects are on osteoblasts. We propose that in vivo treatment with RSV and SyRMs will both restore the youthful balance between osteoclastic bone resorption and osteoblastic bone formation and enhancing bone mineral density and bone quality, but possibly via different mechanisms. We also hypothesize that the SyRMs can exert beneficial effects upon bone independent of Sirt1. 1. Determine the mechanisms whereby RSV, RSV mimetics, and Sirt1 regulate osteoclast and osteoblast formation. The results of this aim will answer the critical questions of whether or not SyRMs inhibit osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting c-Src phosphorylation, Rho GTPase activation, and NFATc1 expression and whether the effects of SyRMs depend upon Sirt1. 2. Determine the skeletal impacts of RSV, RSV mimetics, and Sirt1 in vivo.  The results of this aim will answer the critical questions of whether or not in vivo RSV and  SyRMs prevent age-related and/or ovariectomy-induced bone loss, whether RSV and SyRMs  exert either anabolic and anti-resorptive effects on bone or both, and whether the impacts of RSV  and SyRMs depend upon Sirt1 gene expression.  There is a pressing need for targeted agents to improve the quality of bone and to reduce the adverse consequences of osteoporosis. Our proposed studies will permit us to understand better the mechanism(s) underlying the impacts of RSV and SyRMs and their relationship to Sirt1 expression. Our work will also have significant clinical impact given the widespread and deleterious burden of osteoporosis in the elderly and can be applied to the utilization of RSV and RSV mimetics in the clinic.',\n",
       " 'Since the introduction of the 2009 pandemic virus, influenza infections in pigs have become very challenging for producers and veterinarians to control. Influenza virus not only negatively affects the health and productivity of domestic swine populations, but it also represents a threat to public health because of the risk of zoonotic infections of pandemic potential. Although influenza vaccination is widely used in swine herds, the vaccines do not fully prevent transmission, thus a more comprehensive understanding of influenza disease dynamics and control strategies are urgently needed. We are in a unique position to capitalize on a new collaborative effort to combine already-collected descriptive data on influenza transmission in pigs with novel mathematical modeling approaches in order to address infectious disease challenges. The overall objective of this study is to model influenza transmission dynamics in swine farms in order to mitigate transmission within and between populations through vaccination with the following specific aims: (1.) Model within-farm transmission for populations of pigs in order to determine the optimal vaccination strategy to eliminate influenza. This will include a thorough investigation which class of pigs (e.g. sows, piglets, replacement animals) to target for vaccination, the frequency of vaccination, and the proportion of pigs to vaccinate (e.g. a subpopulation vs. mass vaccination). (2.) Model between-farm aerosol transmission for farms in a region of Minnesota to determine which types of farms to vaccinate to eliminate regional transmission. This project has a high likelihood of success because empirical data is already collected, a mathematician postdoc has been identified, and the modeling framework has been developed.',\n",
       " 'US-UK Collaborative: Persistence of a highly contagious pathogen:Ecological and evolutionary mechanisms in FMD.The persistence of rapidly transmitting, acute pathogens in their natural host populations represents one of the fundamental puzzles in disease ecology: highly contagious pathogens tend to reduce the pool of susceptible hosts to very low numbers, increasing their own risk of extinction during epidemic troughs. This vulnerability constrains the range of pathogen life histories that result in viable population dynamics; nonetheless, highly transmissible pathogens do occur - despite causing rapid host immunity or death.The proposed study will investigate how one of the most contagious animal pathogens known to man, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), overcomes these challenges and persists in isolated populations of its reservoir host, the African buffalo. This study will be one of the first to address this problem head-on, dissecting the contributions of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms to pathogen persistence. Specifically, the study will evaluate (i) whether co-infection by common respiratory pathogens and / or malnutrition during the dry season can trigger FMDV transmission from carrier buffalo; and (ii) the role of viral antigenic shift in limiting host immunity to FMDV at epidemiologically relevant time scales.The centerpiece of the project is a cohort study, in which a captive buffalo herd will be monitored intensively over three years, measuring host-to-host contacts, and tracing FMDV transmission events using viral phylogenetic methods. The investigators will map host contacts onto pathogen transmission, and tease apart the role of behavioral, physiological and immunological drivers in generating heterogeneity in disease transmission among hosts. They will discover whether FMDV transmission from carrier buffalo tends to coincide with secondary pathogenic exposures and / or malnutrition during the dry season - and test whether these associations are causal using a controlled challenge experiment. They will measure rates of viral antigenic evolution directly, and establish the contribution of super-infection by new antigenic variants to FMDV transmission dynamics. Complementary to these empirical approaches the project team will develop mathematical models to extrapolate to other host populations and to provide logical validation for the hypothesized mechanisms underlying FMDV persistence. Samples from 200 free-ranging buffalo, collected previously by the PI, will ensure that the models capture realistic levels of temporal variability in buffalo immunity and co-infection patterns. The study thus combines a strong theoretical framework with controlled experiments and longitudinal observational data from captive and free-living buffalo, to provide both rigor and biological realism.Intellectual Merit. This will be one of the first studies to track transmission events in a near-natural host population comprehensively, overlay the resulting transmission network with animal contact patterns, and identify immunologic and physiologic drivers of heterogeneity in disease transmission. Building on the investigators&#39; previous work on FMDV and buffalo, the study moves away from the paradigm of transmission from carrier hosts during stress-induced immunosuppression, and presents innovative new ideas for ecological and evolutionary drivers of pathogen persistence: for some highly contagious pathogens, robust long-term persistence may depend on co-infection by common pathogens and seasonal variation in host immunity, driven ultimately by resource fluctuations. If true, implications of this finding would be far-reaching, in that it suggests fundamentally different dynamics of contagious, acute pathogens along gradients of environmental variability.Broader impacts. This project will build scientific capacity by supporting integrated training for postdoctoral scientists and students recruited from South Africa, the US and the UK. The project will build strong links between US, UK, and South African institutions, as a basis for future effective collaborations on understanding and controlling animal infectious diseases. A summer research program will provide students with inter-cultural and inter-disciplinary research training opportunities. Results from the study will be communicated directly to relevant veterinary and conservation agencies by policy experts on the project team. Extremely contagious pathogens that cause acute disease are among the most important global public and animal health concerns, because of their high burden of morbidity and mortality, their violent outbreaks, and as potential threats to biosecurity. Understanding the biology of extremely contagious pathogens in their reservoir hosts is an urgent priority because it ultimately underpins control and prevention of the devastating diseases they cause.',\n",

Building on the investigators&#39; previous work on FMDV and buffalo,the study moves away from the paradigm of transmission from carrier hosts during stress-induced immunosuppression, andpresents innovative new ideas for ecological and evolutionary drivers of pathogen persistence: for some highly contagiouspathogens, robust long-term persistence may depend on co-infection by common pathogens and seasonal variation in hostimmunity, driven ultimately by resource fluctuations. If true, implications of this finding would be far-reaching, in that it suggestsfundamentally different dynamics of contagious, acute pathogens along gradients of environmental variability.Broader impacts. This project will build scientific capacity by supporting integrated training for postdoctoral scientists andstudents recruited from South Africa, the US and the UK. The project will build strong links between US, UK, and South Africaninstitutions, as a basis for future effective collaborations on understanding and controlling animal infectious diseases. A summerresearch program will provide students with inter-cultural and inter-disciplinary research training opportunities. Results from thestudy will be communicated directly to relevant veterinary and conservation agencies by policy experts on the project team.Extremely contagious pathogens that cause acute disease are among the most important global public and animal healthconcerns, because of their high burden of morbidity and mortality, their violent outbreaks, and as potential threats to biosecurity.Understanding the biology of extremely contagious pathogens in their reservoir hosts is an urgent priority because it ultimatelyunderpins control and prevention of the devastating diseases they cause.',\n",
       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and small children. RSV infection in mice is characterized by significant immunopathology which is mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Past studies have suggested that CD8+ T cells with different functional properties and characteristics can be elicited following infection or immunization, and may have differential effects on viral clearance and RSV-associated illness. We have described differences between neonatal and adult CD8+ T cell responses elicited during RSV infection. Differences in clonotype, functional avidity, and other intrinsic parameters of the CD8+ T cell response may help dictate the epitope hierarchy established following infection. We have now defined the dynamics of lung-migratory dendritic cell populations in the lung and lung-draining lymph nodes of RSV-infected mice during early life as compared to adulthood and have determined lung dendritic cell populations that induce RSV-specific adaptive T cell responses following infection.  These dendritic cells were found to induce T cell responses in an age-dependent manner, and we have implicated lower costimulatory molecule expression by neonatal dendritic cells as one mechanism for this difference.  Our work in the last year has been greatly aided by the development and characterization of three strains of transgenic mice with CD8+ T cells specific for RSV. Continued work on this study will fully characterize CD8+ T responses to RSV, elucidate important factors that dictate the type of CD8+ T cell response that is generated, and help understand how other cell types regulate the CD8+ T cell response in an age-dependent fashion.',\n",
       " 'The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was launched in 2000 with the goal of stopping transmission of lymphatic filariasis (LF) through yearly mass drug administration (MDA). Although preliminary surveys of the human population in Mali suggested that Wuchereria bancrofti (W. bancrofti) infection was highly endemic in the Sikasso district, baseline entomological data were required to confirm high levels of transmission prior to selection of villages in this region for a study of the impact of MDA on transmission of LF by anopheline vectors. W. bancrofti transmission was assessed in 2001 (pre-MDA) and 2002 (post-MDA) in the Central District of Sikasso in southern Mali by dissection of Anopheles mosquitoes caught using the human landing catch (HLC) method. The relative frequencies and molecular forms of An. gambiae complex were determined. The majority (86%) of the anopheline vectors captured were identified as An. gambiae complex, and these accounted for >90% of the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) during both years of the study. There was a dramatic decrease in the number of An. gambiae complex mosquitoes captured and in the An. gambiae complex infectivity rates following MDA, accounting for the observed decrease in EIR in 2002 (from 12.55 to 3.79 infective bites per person during the transmission season). An. funestus complex mosquitoes were responsible for a low level of transmission, which was similar during both years of the study (1.2 infective bites per person during the transmission season in 2001 and 1.03 in 2002). Based on the entomological data from this study, the district of Sikasso was confirmed as an area of high W. bancrofti transmission. This led to the selection of this area for a multi-national study on the effects of MDA on LF transmission by anopheline vectors. Comparison of vector transmission parameters prior to and immediately following the first round of MDA demonstrated a significant decrease in overall transmission. Importantly, the dramatic variability in EIR over the transmission season suggests that the efficacy of MDA can be maximized by delivering drug at the beginning of the rainy season (just prior to the peak of transmission).Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and particularly Foxp3-expressing Tregs are known to increase during chronic infection, although the exact mechanisms that contribute to their accumulation and mode of action remain unclear. We used flow cytometry and microarray analyses to delineate the phenotype and transcriptional profiles of Tregs in the setting of chronic filarial infection. Using cells from 18 filaria-infected (Fil+) and 19 filaria-uninfected (Fil-) subjects, we found that the frequencies of Foxp3+ Treg expressing CTLA-4, GITR, LAG-3, and IL-10 were significantly higher in Fil+ compared with Fil- subjects. Microarray analysis revealed that, compared with those from Fil-, Foxp3-expressing Treg populations in Fil+ subjects were more heterogeneous and had higher expression of IL-10, CCL-4, IL-29 and CTLA-4, molecules that have been implicated in immune suppression. Moreover, Foxp3-expressing Tregs from Fil+ subjects had markedly upregulated activation-induced apoptotic genes with concomitant down regulation of cell survival genes. To determine whether the expression of apoptotic genes was due to activation, we stimulated Foxp3-expressing Tregs purified from blood bank donors with anti-CD3/CD28 coated beads and using Quantitative Real Time PCR, assessed the expression of some of the genes upregulated in microarray analysis.  To this end, we found that the expression of CTLA-4, CDk8, RAD50, TNFRSF1A, FOXO3 and RHOA was significantly upregualated in stimulated cells compared with unstimulated. Taken together, our results suggest that in patent filarial infection, the expanded nTreg populations are heterogeneous, short-lived, activated and express higher level of regulatory molecules, suggesting a higher turnover, compared to cells from uninfected subjects.',\n",
       " 'Plague is a zoonosis that is present in wild rodent populations worldwide and is transmitted primarily by fleas. Yersinia pestis, the plague bacillus, is unique among the enteric group of gram-negative bacteria in having adopted an arthropod-borne route of transmission. Y. pestis has evolved in such a way as to be transmitted during the brief encounter between a feeding flea and a host. A transmissible infection primarily depends on the ability of Y. pestis to grow in the flea as a biofilm that is embedded in a complex extracellular matrix. Bacteria in the biofilm phenotype are deposited into the dermis together with flea saliva, elements which cannot be satisfactorily mimicked by needle-injection of Y. pestis from laboratory cultures. The objective of this project is to identify and determine the function of Y. pestis genes that mediate flea-borne transmission and the initial encounter with the host innate immune system at the infection site in the skin. We study the interaction of Y. pestis with its insect vector by using an artificial feeding apparatus to infect fleas with uniform doses of wild-type or specific Y. pestis mutants. We seek to identify Y. pestis genes that are required for the bacteria to infect the flea midgut and to produce a biofilm that blocks the flea foregut and that is required for efficient transmission. The strategy entails first identifying bacterial genes that are differentially expressed in the flea by gene expression analysis and other techniques. Specific mutations are then introduced into these genes, and the mutants tested for their ability to infect and block the flea vector. Identification of such transmission factors allows further studies into the molecular mechanisms of the bacterial infection of the flea vector. Detailed understanding of the interaction with the insect host may lead to novel strategies to interrupt the transmission cycle.\\tDuring the last year, we continued to investigate the regulation of Y. pestis genes required for the biofilm life stage in the flea vector.  This year we showed that a major bacterial gene regulatory system (known as PhoP-PhoQ) is induced during infection of the flea vector and is required to produce a normal transmissible infection.  Because PhoP-PhoQ upregulates several genes required for bacterial resistance to innate immunity, induction of the PhoP-PhoQ system in the arthropod vector prior to transmission may preadapt Y. pestis to resist the initial encounter with the mammalian innate immune response. We also continue to investigate the genetic changes that led to the evolutionarily recent transition of Y. pestis to an arthropod-borne transmission route.  Many nonfunctional genes (pseudogenes) occur on the Y. pestis genome; some of them are implicated in regulating the biofilm phenotype that enhances transmission by fleas.  We have found that restoration of four pseudogenes with the equivalent functional genes of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, the recent ancestor of Y. pestis, reduces transmissibility in the flea.  Conversely, mutation of these genes in Y. pseudotuberculosis results in the gain of biofilm-forming ability in the flea and loss of oral toxicity to fleas.  Thus, gene loss appears to have played a significant role in Y. pestis evolution. In collaboration with the Genomics Unit of the RML Research Technologies Branch, we are examining and characterizing the transcriptomes of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and our biofilm-producing Y. pseudotuberculosis mutant during growth in vitro and during infection of the flea, with the goal of identifying genes and gene regulatory pathways that are important for flea-borne transmission. The in vivo and in vitro transcriptomic comparisons between these three strains are designed to broadly identify candidate components of biofilm regulatory pathways and other genes important for the recent evolutionary adaptation to flea-borne transmission. Significant differences in the expression of orthologous genes in the flea might be indicative of evolutionary changes in gene regulatory pathways. Moreover, the comparison of Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis transcripts grown in vitro would help us to select gene candidates involved in the acute toxicity of Y. pseudotuberculosis for fleas.  In a separate study published during FY2013, we investigated the possible role of Y. pestis insecticidal-like toxins that are highly expressed during infection of the flea. We found that, although these toxin-like genes are highly induced during Y. pestis infection of the flea, they are neither toxic to fleas nor required to establish a normal transmissible infection.  Instead, they appear to have a role after transmission in resisting phagyocytosis by host neutrophils and macrophages.  We have also further developed models to examine host-parasite interactions in the dermis after transmission by flea bite, and are completing a project on the host immune response to flea saliva and how this might influence transmission.  Last year we established a colony of the ground- and rock-squirrel flea Oropsylla montana, an important vector of plague in the U.S.  This year we have done several experimental transmission trials to compare biofilm-independent early-phase and biofilm-dependent transmission mechanisms, and the overall transmission efficiency and the biofilm-dependent blockage ability of Y. pestis in X. cheopis and O. montana fleas.',\n",
       " 'Background: We aim to understand the degree and duration of protection induced by HIV treatment killing of malaria parasites (called infection-treatment vaccination or ITV, alternatively referred to as chemoprophylaxis vaccination or CVac), and the role of such ITV in acquired, malaria specific anti-infection immunity in the field. We also aim to study the effects of HIV treatments on malaria transmission.Naturally acquired immunity to malaria only develops after a number of disease episodes, and is imperfect as it fails to protect against infection.  Blood stage (BS) malaria infection, which is the stage associated with malaria clinical symptoms, may prevent anti-infection immune responses. In contrast, complete protective anti-infection immunity is induced with attenuated malaria parasites that arrest during liver stage development. Anti-infection immunity is also observed in mice that are infected with wildtype sporozoites (the infective form of the parasite) and then given drugs that kill LS parasites, and in humans that are infected with wildtype parasites while receiving chloroquine, a drug that kills BS parasites. Also, chemoprophylaxis studies in endemic areas likely failed to induce anti-infection immunity as the drug regimens employed may have permitted BS exposure. Taken together, these data indicate that exposure to LS parasites and avoidance of BS infection can induce highly effective anti-infection immunity.  Pre-clinical data show that HIV protease inhibitors (HIV PIs), but not non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have anti-BS activity, but effects on LS parasites require further study.  Separately, the antibiotic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) reduces clinical malaria episodes presumably from an anti-BS effect, but whether an anti-LS effect occurs and how this may contribute to anti-infection immunity is unknown. ITV-like effects might occur in naturally exposed populations who are receiving HIV treatments with antimalarial effects.  Also, because these drugs are taken continuously, they may be more likely to attenuate LS and prevent BS infection via constant pressure, although the degree of effect will likely depend on transmission intensity and host immunologic status. Separately, HIV PIs have been shown to affect sexual stage parasites (gametocytes), but their effects on later stage gametocytes and mosquito stage parasites  (TS) remains unknown.  Also, while other antifolates may not kill gametocytes but do kill mosquito stages, effect of TMP-SMX on TS requires further investigation.We hypothesize that 1) HIV PIs and TMP-SMX will kill LS and TS parasites at clinically relevant concentrations (CRCs), that is, concentrations achieved in the serum of patients on standard dosing regimens; 2) the use of drugs with LS-killing effects will contribute to acquisition of anti-infection immunity in areas where African children who receive these treatments; and 3) HIV treatments with TS-killing effects will contribute to reduced transmission.Based on these hypothesis, we propose the following projects and summarize our accomplishments:PROJECT 1: To examine the impact of HIV treatments on malaria liver stages (LS) and anti-infection immunity in vitro and in animal models at clinically relevant concentrations (CRCs).Significance: Because each of these HIV treatments are used in malaria-endemic areas, we believe our in vitro and animal data will provide evidence for further investigation of HIV treatment effects in the field.  HIV treatment regimens (choice, and in the case of TMP-SMX prophylaxis, duration) could be tailored for patients in malaria-endemic areas if these drugs reduce malaria burden. Major Findings/Progress: 1) The HIV PI lopinavir, and the antimicrobial TMP-SMX, but not the NNRTI nevirapine, kills P. falciparum LS in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations (CRCs) and 2) Repeated exposures to live sporozoites with TMP-SMX prophylaxis induces development anti-infection, sustained, stage-specific immunityPROJECT 2: To examine the impact of HIV treatments on malaria gametocytes, mosquito stages, and transmission in vitro.Significance:  HIV-infected patients population (especially those with more severe immunocompromise) have higher parasite burdens and more frequent malaria. HIV treatments that reduce transmission may contribute to reduced malaria burden at a community level. Major Findings/Progress: The HIV PI lopinavir, but not the NNRTI, nevirapine, kills gametocytes (A) and mosquito stages (B) of P. falciparum in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations (CRCs). TMP-SMX does not kill gametocytes, but kills mosquito stages at CRCs.PROJECT 3: To examine the impact of HIV treatments on malaria infection incidence and anti-infection immunity in HIV-infected or HIV-exposed, uninfected African children.Significance: Currently, the World Health Organization recommends HIV management with antiretroviral therapy (ART): first line regimens include an NNRTI (in children, nevirapine) and 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with few exceptions, and second line regimens include an HIV PI (in children, lopinavir-ritonavir) and 2 NRTIs. Separately, TMP-SMX is used in HIV-exposed, uninfected children in resource-limited settings for extended durations because children in such settings breastfeed out of necessity, which poses a continued risk for HIV transmission.  Extending or curtailing the duration of TMP-SMX prophylaxis has been a source of debate due to concerns over development of antibacterial TMP-SMX resistance.  If any drugs used in HIV management are deemed to have an effect in reducing the clinical burden of malaria, either by direct drug-parasite killing effect on LS or TS, or via an ITV-like induction of immunity, their use may become tailored to maximize parasite killing and protective anti-infection immunity, and to minimize transmission. Major Findings/Progress: Our observational substudy examining HIV PIs vs. NNRTIs (in collaboration with the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Network, or IMPAACT) has reached full enrollment at 3 sites, and these children have now been followed for over 2 years.  Samples processing as well as data analysis is ongoing.  Separately, our study examining TMP-SMX effect on malaria infection and anti-infection immunity is in planning stages.PROJECT 4: To examine the impact of HIV treatments on malaria transmission in HIV-infected or HIV exposed, uninfected African children. Significance:  HIV treatments may impact malaria parasite transmission in the community.  If certain HIV treatments contribute to reduction of transmission, their use may become standardized (i.e., HIV PIs preferentially used in malaria endemic areas) or timed to capitalize on such effects (i.e., TMP-SMX prophylaxis in HIV-uninfected children extended).Major Findings/Progress:  Our observational substudy (examining HIV PIs vs. NNRTIs) has reached full enrollment and these children have now been followed for over 2 years.  Samples collection and processing as well as data analysis is ongoing.  Our study examining TMP-SMX effect on malaria infection and anti-infection immunity is in planning stages.',\n",
       " 'RSV and HMPV are cytoplasmic enveloped RNA viruses of the paramyxovirus family. Their genomes are single strands of negative-sense RNA of 15.2 kb (RSV) and 13.3 kb (HMPV) that encode 10 mRNAs and 11 unique proteins (RSV) or 8 mRNAs and 9 unique proteins (HMPV). Each virus encodes a nucleoprotein N, phosphoprotein P, matrix protein M, small hydrophobic protein SH, major glycoprotein G, fusion glycoprotein F, M2-1 and M2-2 polymerase factors, and polymerase L. In addition, RSV encodes two nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2. &#8232;We have been working to develop attenuating mutations in RSV that have improved genetic and phenotypic stability, for the purpose of producing live-attenuated vaccine strains with increased stability. In one approach, we worked to create attenuating mutations by deleting one or several codons at a given locus in coding sequence in the viral genome, using known missense mutations as a guide. Most of the attempted codon-deletions proved to be lethal to the virus, but we found that deletion of codon 1313 in the L polymerase gene (del1313) resulted in a virus that replicated with wt-like efficiency at the permissive temperature of 32C but was restricted at 37C. In addition, it was restricted 50-fold and 150-fold in the upper and lower respiratory tract, respectively, of mice. We combined this del1313 mutation with the previously described attenuating NS2 gene deletion (delNS2) to produce the recombinant live-attenuated RSV vaccine candidate delNS2/del1313. During in vitro stress tests involving serial passage at incrementally increasing temperatures to evaluate genetic stability, a second-site compensatory mutation was detected in close proximity of del1313, namely I1314T. This site was genetically and phenotypically stabilized by an I1314L substitution. Combination of I1314L with delNS2/del1313 yielded genetic stability at physiological temperature. This stabilized vaccine candidate was moderately temperature-sensitive and had a level of restriction in experimental animals comparable to that of MEDI-559 and RSV cps2, two promising RSV vaccine candidate that presently are in or entering clinical trials. The level of attenuation and the genetic stability of delNS2/del1313 indicate that it is a promising candidate suitable for evaluation in pediatric phase I studies. This virus has been manufactured into a clinical lot and has been approved by the FDA for studies beginning this year in seropositive children 6-59 months of age. &#8232;We evaluated the strategy of codon-pair deoptimization (CPD) as a means of developing genetically and phenotypically stable attenuated RSV strains. It is well known that there is a bias in codon-pair usage in nature. Specifically, any given pair of amino acids has the possibility to be encoded by a variety of different combinations of synonymous codons due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, but the observed usage of codon-pairs typically is biased to favor a subset of the possible combinations. One factor in this bias is thought to be translational efficiency and accuracy, because certain combinations of tRNA pairs are favored at the A and P sites in the ribosome due to tRNA geometry and other factors. CPD involves the deliberate introduction of under-represented synonymous codon-pairs into numerous sites in protein-coding sequence to achieve sub-optimal expression. These substitutions only involve the ORFS, and thus non-protein-coding genome regions are not affected. Also, CPD involves only synonymous codon substitutions, and thus amino acid coding is unaffected and the antigens remain unchanged. In addition, CPD applied to one or several genes typically involves hundreds or thousands of nucleotide changes, and thus should be highly refractory to de-attenuation. Recently, CPD was applied to poliovirus and influenza virus and was shown to result in attenuated strains. We designed the following set of four CPD RSV genomes in which the indicated ORFs were recoded: (i) Min A; NS1, NS2, N, P, M, and SH (i.e., the left-hand third of the genome); (ii) Min B; G and F (located in the middle of the genome); (iii) Min L; L (located at the right-hand end of the genome); and (iv) Min FLC; all ORFs except M2-1 and M2-2. The recoded genome regions were synthesized commercially and the four CPD viruses were constructed and recovered by reverse genetics. All of the CPD viruses were temperature-sensitive (level of sensitivity: Min FLC>Min L>Min B>Min A) for replication in vitro. This was unexpected given the lack of change in amino acid coding, which was confirmed by re-sequencing. All of the CPD mutants grew less efficiently in vitro than wild type (wt) RSV, even at the permissive temperature of 32C (growth efficiency: wt>Min L>Min A>Min FLC>Min B). Thus, CDP of G and F ORFs provided the greatest effect. The CPD viruses exhibited a range of restriction in mice and African Green Monkeys (AGM) and induced immunity against wt RSV. This study identified new vaccine candidates for RSV and showed that CPD of a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus can rapidly generate vaccine candidates with a range of attenuation phenotypes.RSV infection results in the formation of viral inclusion bodies (IBs) that appear as large, prominent, electron-dense structures in the cytoplasm. IBs are thought to be sites of nucleocapsid accumulation and viral RNA synthesis. We found that, during RSV infection, the IBs also were the sites of major sequestration of two proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways. These are phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (p38-P), a key regulator of cellular inflammatory and stress responses, and O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (OGN) transferase (OGT), an enzyme that catalyzes the post-translational addition of OGN to protein targets to regulate cellular processes including signal transduction, transcription, translation, proteasomal degradation, and the stress response. The virus-induced sequestration of p38-P in viral IBs resulted in a substantial reduction in the accumulation of a downstream signaling substrate, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2). Sequestration of OGT in IBs was associated with suppression of stress granule (SG) formation. Thus, while the RSV IBs are thought to play an essential role in viral replication, the present results show that they also play a role in suppressing the cellular response to viral infection. The sequestration of p38-P and OGT in IBs appeared to be reversible: severe oxidative stress resulting from a brief arsenite treatment transformed large IBs into a scattering of smaller bodies, suggestive of partial disassembly, and this was associated with MK2 phosphorylation and OGN-addition. Unexpectedly, the RSV M2-1 protein was found to localize in SGs that formed during oxidative stress. This protein was previously shown to be a viral transcription elongation factor, and the present findings provide the first evidence of possible involvement in SG activities during RSV infection. This involvement is intriguing because the M2-1 protein has some structural similarity - including the presence of a CCCH zinc-binding motif - with the cellular protein tristetraprolin. Tristetraprolin is a SG-associated protein that helps regulate the stability of certain cellular mRNAs including a number encoding pro-inflammatory and antiviral proteins. This suggests a possible role for the viral M2-1 mRNA in mRNA stability.',\n",
       " 'In collaboration with Dr. Fernando Polack (Vanderbilt University) and the Infant Foundation in Buenos Aires, Argentina we recruited a prospective cohort of children aged 0-9 months of age from 5 hospitals in Buenos Aires. The primary clinical outcome is severity of disease (O2 saturation < 93%) and the secondary outcomes are RSV titer and Th2 polarization (blood lymphocytes are isolated and challenged with pro-inflammatory agonists including LPS). From 2003-2006, we recruited approximately 800 children to the study: 400 infected with RSV (240 with severe disease, 160 with mild disease) and 400 controls (uninfected). Our initial genetic analyses have focused on the role of functional SNPs in TLR4 (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile), and NRF2 (-653A/G, -651G/A and -617C/A). These genes have been identified as candidate susceptibility genes for RSV infection in mice, and TLR4 has also been associated with RSV infection in children. In our initial analyses, we found that the -651G/A SNP was only found in severe RSV cases and conferred greater risk of disease relative to the wild type (OR: 1.9; CI: 1.4, 2.7). We also found that children heterozygous for the Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile mutations in TLR4 were at higher risk of severe RSV disease relative to children with wild-type TLR4 genotype (OR: 1.7; CI: 1.2, 2.6). However, when socioeconomic status (SES) was considered, we found children from low SES families and heterozygous for TLR4 Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile mutations had significantly less severe disease compared to wild type (4% severe disease vs 11% severe disease, p<0.05) compared with children from middle/high SES (9% severe disease vs 2% mild disease, p<0.05). These results are consistent with a role for TLR4 in RSV disease severity, but interaction of TLR4 genotype with environment must be considered when evaluating risk of these mutations. We have used human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL; Coriell Institute) to evaluate inter-individual variation in response to RSV, test the role of candidate susceptibility genes, and identify basal gene expression patterns that predict RSV responsivity. Databases on human sequence variation (dbSNP and HapMap) and functional annotation were queried for relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and used to select LCLs with particular genotypes with SNPs of interest. These LCLs were infected with RSV and significant inter-individual variation in RSV infectivity across multiple LCLs indicated that genetic background is an important determinant of suscepti bility to infection. Moreover, enhanced (3-5 fold) viral load was found in LCLs with a non-synonymous coding SNP (rs469390) in MX1, which is involved in suppressing viral replication in infected cells. In a case control study of infants with mild or severe RSV disease, a positive association was found between individuals homozygous for the minor allele of rs469390 and development of severe disease. We also developed a model to predict RSV infection using data from individuals in the HapMap collection. Baseline mRNA expression of HapMap individuals from six different microarray data sets were initially assessed for correlation with viral load. Of transcripts that were positively correlated, the 5 highest and 5 lowest viral load responders were selected for the model, resulting in 61 genes that associated with viral load and were differentially expressed in at least 3 of 6 baseline data sets. Using heuristic modeling of the 61 genes, a 27 gene transcript model was the best predictor (RSV prediction, p<0.001; rsq 0.95) of viral load in individuals for which infection response had already been quantified. We found 75% accuracy in predicting RSV infectivity in test set LCLs with similar expression profiles. This novel cell model of RSV disease can thus be used translationally to identify functionally relevant candidate susceptibility genes. We also developed a mouse model of RSV disease by infecting 34inbred mouse strains (JAX) with RSV-19 or vehicle control. Significant inter-strain variation in protein, cellular, mucus cell metaplasia (MCM), and RSV-N mRNA expression phenotypes following infection were found among the 34 inbred strains. The most severe RSV disease pathology was found in A/J and Balb/cJ mice, while C3H/HeJ mice were among the most resistant. Collaborating with Dr. Tim Wiltshire (UNC), we then used the SNPster algorithm for haplotype association mapping (HAM) of maximum RSV response phenotypes. Significant associations were found for MCM, RSV-N mRNA, and BAL monocytes, lymphocytes, and PMNs. The most significant association was found on chromosome 1 for BAL monocytes. Within this region are 6 genes that have SNPs that associate with BAL monocytes, including Marco. We identified a non-synonymous coding SNP (rs30741725) that causes a threonine to serine substitution in amino acid 476, and based on predicted protein structure change, this substitution severely affects receptor binding. Further, RSV-induced BAL monocytes and lymphocytes were significantly greater 5 d PI in strains that are homozygous for this SNP relative to strains that have the wild type allele, suggesting a functional role for the mutation in RSV disease. We also found that relative to Marco+/+ mice, significantly greater histopathological changes and numbers of monocytes and PMNs were found in Marco-/- mice 5 d PI providing additional evidence for a protective role for Marco in RSV disease. Collaborating with Dr. Fernando Polack, each subject from the RSV cohort (described above) was genotyped for a functional SNP in the MARCO promoter (rs3806496; chrom 2, 119.698574 Mb). Logistic regression was used for analysis where the response variable was O2 saturation. The allele frequency of MARCO (T allele) was 0.47 and in HWE. The likelihood ratio test was 16.8 with 1 df, p=4x10-5. The relative risk estimate for the T allele is 0.66 which means that it is protective or the C allele (RR=1.52) is causative. While essential to repeat these findings in another independent population, these novel studies support the hypothesis that MARCO is an important determinant of RSV disease severity, and demonstrates the translational value of the model to understand human RSV disease.We then used a combined genetics and genomics approach (genetical genomics) to understand the genetic basis of RSV disease susceptibility. To identify transcripts differentially expressed at baseline that predict response to RSV, baseline lung gene transcript expression for 29 inbred mouse strains (Novartis) was correlated to phenotype data from the RSV strain screen (described above) using linear and random forest regression. These analyses identified a battery of gene transcripts that were differentially expressed at baseline and significantly correlated with RSV disease severity including Ptgs2 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2), Nqo1 (NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1), and IL18bp (interleukin 18 binding protein). To determine whether genotype differences account for differential gene expression we utilized expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis using FastMap. At baseline, there were 125 genes with significant cis-eQTLs, where an association exists between gene expression and genotype at that particular genes locus. Expression of three of these genes significantly correlated with RSV disease phenotypes. Together, these approaches have identified genetic markers of susceptibility to RSV disease to predict severe responders and potentially provide more effective therapeutic targets.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION: Cell-based transmission of HIV is far more efficient than the transfer of cell-free virus, and is likely to play a prominent role in HIV transmission when infected cells enter the bloodstream, as can occur during the intravenous injection of drugs by substance abusers. This may complicate vaccination efforts, because cell-based transmission allows HIV to evade neutralizing antibodies. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cell-to-cell transmission thus appears particularly relevant for the prevention of HIV transmission among drug abusers.  We have identified the host proteins kindlin-3 and pacsin2 as novel binding partners HIV-1 Gag. Both proteins are dispensable for the completion of a full replication cycle after infection with cell-free virus. Nevertheless, both are essential for the spreading of HIV-1 among T cells, indicating that kindlin-3 and pacsin2 are critical for the cell-to-cell transmissionof HIV-1.  Kindlin-3 is required for the function of integrins such as LFA-1, which has been implicated in HIV transmission. However, our data demonstrate a striking requirement for kindlin-3 for HIV-1 replication even in T lymphoid cells lacking LFA-1. Our working model is that HIV-1 Gag mimics the kindlin-recruiting activity of integrins to induce donor cell polarization towards the virological synapse and thereby promote virus transfer.  Pacsin2 can generate membrane curvature and nucleate filopodia formation. HIV-1 frequently buds from filopodia, and viral filopodia capped by Gag have been implicated in HIV-1 cell-cell transmission. Thus, pacsin2 may be important for HIV-1 transmission because it is involved in viral filopodia formation.  The goal of the project is to understand the roles of kindlin-3 and pacsin2, and of thecellular pathways in which these proteins are known to function, in the spreading of HIV-1. We also propose to investigate whether these pathways are altered among a cohort of elite controllers that includes drug abusers. The planned research may yield important translational insights into how to reduce HIV transmission among drug abusers.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to decipher how RNA viruses suppress the host's innate immune response. The short-term goal is to glean a biochemical and mechanistic understanding how the two unique nonstructural (NS) proteins of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) operate to suppress both the induction and function of type I interferon (IFN), which enables the virus to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection and associated mortality. The proposed studies are founded on several novel observations that we have made recently: (i) RSV NS proteins can form NS1-NS2 heteromer. (ii) Between them, NS1 and NS2 degrade multiple members of both IFN induction and response pathways, such as RIG-I, IKK¿, IRF3, IRF7, TRAF3 and STAT2. (iii) By fractionating extracts from A549 cells in which either NS1, or NS2, or both were expressed recombinantly, we isolated three distinct complexes of the following major constituents, depending on which NS was expressed: (1) NS1 Complex or NS1C: NS1, Elongin BC, Cullin 2, Rbx1; (2) NS2 Complex or NS2C: NS2, Elongin BC, Cullin 5, Rbx2; (3) the dual NS1/NS2 Complex or NS1/2C: NS1, NS2, Elongin BC, Cullin 2 & 5, Rbx1 & 2, BAG2, RAD23B. Thus, NS1/2C appears to be a heterodimer of NS1C and NS2C, but contains two additional host proteins, BAG2 and RAD23B. (v) We have developed in vitro assays for all three NS complexes, showing that they possess E3 ligase activity. (vi) The specificity of recruitment of these IFN-related substrates to the NS complexes seems to be determined by ISG15 conjugation. (vii) We made the unexpected discovery that NS1 is a phosphoprotein, likely phosphorylated by an Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) family protein kinase, which opens a novel avenue of NS1 activation. In this AREA (R15) project, we will pursue two Specific Aims, in which altogether we will: test the role of the E3 ligase components in the NS complexes; validate the putative BC box domain of NS1 and NS2; interrogate the role of ISGylation in NS E3 ligase substrate specificity; explore the role of accessory subunits (BAG2, RAD23B) and the phosphorylations of NS1 and BAG2; and lastly, validate the role of phosphorylation of NS1 in vivo by constructing and using recombinant phosphosite NS1 mutant RSV in the mouse model. Together, our results should provide new molecular insights into how a virally hijacked host cellular ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation system functions. It may also offer a framework for future antiviral regimen targeting these complexes. Finally, it would offer our students at CSU a springboard to learn various aspects of protein-protein interaction, ubiquitination and protein phosphorylation, with special reference to viral suppression of innate immunity.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant public health concern. It is the major cause of respiratory disease in infants. It also causes severe disease in individuals who are immunocompromised, elderly or have underlying lung disorders, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Currently there is no vaccine or effective antiviral drug to treat patients infected with RSV. Treatment is limited to supportive care, which in severe cases requires hospitalization and intensive care. Thus, there is a clear need for anti-RSV drugs that limit the severity of RSV disease to reduce the mortality associated with RSV, as well as the need for intensive treatment. An ideal target for antiviral drugs is the RSV RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), as it has unique and essential enzymatic activities. The RdRp transcribes and replicates the non-segmented negative sense RNA genome and is capable of initiating both activities from the same viral promoter. The goal of this project is to generate detailed molecular information about key functional and structural properties of the RSV RdRp. The work is divided into three major aims. The experiments in Aim 1 will elucidate the mechanisms by which the RdRp initiates transcription and RNA replication from two sites within the same promoter element, and determine the likelihood of using small molecules to successfully inhibit these steps. Aim 2 will determine how the RdRp is assembled into fully-competent transcriptase and replicase complexes, and will investigate how these complexes are regulated. The research in Aim 3 will utilize negative stain and cryo-electron microscopy to gain insight into the structural characteristics of the RdRp alone and in association with promoter RNA and the nucleocapsid. This research will significantly improve our understanding of the functional and structural properties of the RdRp and provide insights that could be exploited for rational development of antiviral drugs.',\n",
       " \"Antiretroviral treatment (ART) markedly reduces the risk of HIV transmission between stable HIV discordantheterosexual partners and increasing ART use can effect  population-level  reductions in HIV incidence.Whether or not HIV prevention interventions, such as ART  Treatment as Prevention  (TasP) strategies cansignificantly reduce epidemic growth rates remains a matter of considerable debate, though currentcommunity-randomized TasP trials will require vast infrastructure and financial resources. Alternative, lessresource-prohibitive approaches are needed, that ideally would also provide real-time insight into HIVtransmission dynamics and be easily modified to address unique regional and epidemiological factors.Prospective studies of prevention and treatment interventions that target epidemiologic  hot spots  of HIVtransmission may provide an opportunity to efficiently interrupt HIV transmission chains. Effective preventioninterventions are particularly relevant in populations of men who have sex with men (MSM) since theirincidence rates are disproportionately high compared to other risk groups. We propose to use molecularepidemiology and computational modeling to estimate in real time the risk of onward HIV transmission innewly HIV diagnosed persons. We have shown that by evaluating HIV sequences that are generated in 'real-time' after a participant is identified from our San Diego Primary HIV infection Cohort (SD PIC), a partialtransmission network can be inferred rapidly and reliably, and this network can be leveraged to better measurethe efficacy of treatments and interventions, correlates of transmission risk, and estimate the size and featuresof the San Diego HIV epidemic. The proposed study will also address concerns related to patientconfidentiality, specifically - unintended disclosure of HIV status or a putative transmission link. We will developsophisticated quantitative methods to preserve privacy prior to future consideration of potential public healthapplications. Our primary hypothesis is that the efficacy of HIV prevention interventions, such as TasP (i.e.,ART), can be measured within a well-characterized MSM epidemic, using network statistics to assess real timechanges in HIV transmission dynamics within the population. This proposal will address the following SpecificAims: 1) To infer the San Diego HIV transmission network using molecular epidemiology and use agent-basedsimulations to estimate features of the underlying infected population and efficacy of potential interventions, 2)To assess the potential of molecular epidemiology and network statistics to measure the efficacy of ART as anetwork-based prevention intervention, by comparing HIV transmission rates in persons who initiate early ARTcompared to those who either delay or decline ART, and 3) To develop and deploy privacy preserving methodsfor computing transmission network statistics. These same methods could be easily replicated in a prospectivefashion across diverse HIV epidemics and could help to prioritize interventions within the scope of availableresources.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children worldwide. In premature neonates, RSV infection results in high levels of morbidity and mortality. In the United States alone, there are more than 125,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths per year attributable to RSV. The only prophylaxis for RSV is Synagis (palivizumab; MedImmune), a humanized murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets the RSV glycoprotein F and has been shown to reduce the rate of RSV associated hospitalization by 50%. In order to prevent a single hospitalization it has been estimated that 16-18 neonates need to be treated with Synagis. Since a single course of Synagis treatment can cost in excess of $10000 per infant, the resulting cost-effectiveness analysis is not favorable. Moreover, due to this high cost, Synagis is inaccessible to children in developing nations and is unavailable in 4 of the 5 most populous countries - more than half the world's population does not have access to this life-saving treatment. Further, reports of Synagis-resistant RSV strains emphasize the need for additional anti-RSV products against different epitopes. Aridis Pharmaceutical has screened RSV infected patients and identified a naturally occurring human monoclonal IgG ('AR-201') with higher potency than Synagis that neutralizes Synagis-resistant strains. The aim of this proposal is to further the development of AR-201 to address the above mentioned limitations. To this end, Aridis Pharmaceutical has teamed with Mapp Biopharmaceutical to jointly develop a mAb product (AR- 201) with the following characteristics:          1. Fully human (Synagis is a humanized mouse mAb)          2. Higher affinity and in vitro neutralization potency than Synagis          3. Binds a different epitope than Synagis and neutralizes a Synagis-resistant strain   4. Increased serum half-life so injections can be administered less frequently than the monthly dosing required for Synagis          5. Lower cost due to manufacture in Nicotiana benthamiana using the highly scalable Rapid Antibody Manufacturing Platform (RAMP)          In Specific Aim 1, we will produce AR-201 in both the RAMP system and in CHO cells. AR-201 will be expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana and CHO cells as both the unmodified sequence and as sequences introducing amino acid mutations that result in increased affinity for FcRn resulting in extended serum half- life. In Specific Aim 2, the mAbs will be compared in vitro. Measurements will assess affinity for glycoprotein F and neutralization activity of the mAbsagainst a large panel of RSV isolates including Synagis-resistant strains. In Specific Aim 3, the mAbs will be compared in vivo. The cotton rat model will be used to compare the efficacy of the mAb variants to select a lead mAb for continued product development in a subsequent Phase 2 SBIR proposal.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today, the majority of new HIV-1 infections result from heterosexual transmission with HIV-1 CCR5-using, R5 strains. However, there is a tight bottleneck during transmission so that only a single virus variant is transmitted in about 80% of infections. It is not known whether the transmitted viruses carry an advantage over strains that fail to transmit. However, R5 envelopes vary extensively in different properties that are likely to have a strong impact on HIV-1 transmission. These properties include (1) macrophage-tropism, (2) capacity to infect cells via low levels of CCR5 and (3) decreased sensitivity to CCR5 ligands including chemokines. Our hypothesis is that HIV-1 transmission is conferred by envelopes with distinct properties that confer an advantage for transmission. We propose the following aims. Aim 1: To investigate whether transmitted founder/acute envelopes form a distinct subset with particular properties: We will investigate HIV-1 R5 clade B and C envs for the three properties described above. We will include envs from the acute stage of infection including founder envelopes that closely represent transmitted strains. We will compare with R5 envelopes from later disease stages that cover the wide variation in the properties to be investigated. Aim 1 experiments will thus reveal whether transmitted founder/acute envelopes form a distinct subset with a particular set of properties. Aim 2: To evaluate whether founder/acute or other R5 envelopes with specific properties confer an enhanced tropism for Langerhan's cells or ectocervical explant cultures as a model for male-to-female transmission: We will investigate the R5 founder/acute envelopes as well as later disease stage envelopes that cover the variation documented in aim 1. These envelopes will be tested for infection of different DC (including LCs) and ectocervical explant cultures and investigated for trans-infection of T-cells via DCs.  Together, these experiments will help elucidate how different env properties impact on transmission. Aim 3: To identify the envelope determinants that confer efficient infection of ectocervical explant cultures: We will map envelope determinants that confer efficient infection of ectocervical explant cultures.  Our proposal will provide the first comprehensive study of how variation in the properties of R5 envs of different clades impacts on their capacity to infect different DC subsets and ectocervical explant cultures as a model for male-to-female transmission. Importantly, we will identify env properties and determinants that confer efficient transmission. The data obtained will provide new insights into the mechanisms of transmission and help identify vulnerabilities in transmitter envelopes that can be targeted by microbicides and vaccines.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many important biological determinants of HIV-1 disease progression and transmission map to the envelope glycoprotein, including antibody neutralization susceptibility, viral tropism for entry and epitopes for T cell response. Genetic and phenotypic characterizations of the envelope gene suggest a bottleneck effect in the spread of the virus to other body compartments and transmission, resulting in a predominantly homogenous viral population. However, the limitations in current methods to accurately assign HIV-1 coreceptor usage, distinguish genetic variations and detect minor variants in the HIV quasispecies within a patient and between transmission pairs have led to controversial findings. Furthermore, the small patient sample size studied has been too small to make broad generalization regarding mechanisms of HIV transmission and pathogensis. Lastly, these various properties of the envelope gene have been studied predominantly in subtype B infection and less clearly elucidated in HIV-1 subtype C, the most rapidly spreading and prevalent infection worldwide. We hypothesize that a heterogenous HIV-1 population with different envelope sequences and coreceptor usage are transmitted during infection but is not fully characterized and measured by our current available techniques. We propose to use novel and more sensitive methods to determine coreceptor usage and to perform in-depth sequencing and genetic analyses of the envelope gene from a large subtype C clinical cohort from Botswana. The envelope gene in subtype C infection will be studied in longitudinal samples, as well as between plasma-breast milk and mother-infant pairs. We plan to study in greater depth the properties of the HIV-1 subtype C envelope glycoprotein with the following specific aims: 1) identify clinical and genetic determinants of coreceptor switching, 2) assess for correlates of breastfeeding transmission of HIV-1 and 3) examine pattern of viral transmission among mother-to-child transmitting pairs occurring through different routes of MTCT using ultradeep sequencing. The results of this study will further the understanding of viral evolution in the context of transmission and disease progression, identify clinical correlates of transmission and disease progression, and ultimately give insights into potential strategies of prevention, treatment and vaccine development in those parts of the world most affected by HIV.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a member of the paramyxovirus family, is the leading cause of infant hospitalization from infectious diseases in the United States. Regular re-infection of adults during seasonal epidemics provides the ground for caregiver-to-baby transmissions, which aggravate the problem. Despite extensive research, no vaccine protection is available and current antibody therapy-based immunoprophylaxis remains reserved for high-risk patients. Recognizing the unmet pediatric clinical need for efficacious, readily applicable and cost-effective RSV therapeutics, it is the overarching goal of this proposal to apply a rigorous drug development approach to the problem and ultimately identify an anti-RSV therapeutic candidate and at least one mechanistically distinct alternative compound that are suitable for IND-enabling formal development.  Narrowly focused drug discovery campaigns are at high risk of early stage failure. We hypothesize that a comprehensive anti-RSV approach interrogating the full host-pathogen interactome for pathogen-directed and host-directed drug candidates has the highest prospect of ultimately yielding viable clinical candidates. This is based on the realization that traditional pathogen-directed therapeutics enjoy an excellent clinical record but can be compromised by emerging viral resistance and/or a narrow pathogen indication spectrum, whereas host-directed antivirals promise to overcome these limitations, yet are at present predominantly still in preclinical development. Building on our multiple-year expertise in the development of myxovirus inhibitors, we have in pilot studies engineered a first in class recombinant RSV expressing a luciferase reporter and developed an innovative drug screening protocol that allows the simultaneous identification of pathogen- directed and host-directed antivirals in a single-well setting. Proof-o-concept implementation of this screen has yielded, amongst others, a novel pathogen-specific small-molecule RSV entry inhibitor with exquisite toxicity profile and an innovative host-directed agonist class of cellular antiviral defense pathways. Lead compounds of both series show nanomolar inhibitory activity against pathogenic RSV variants. To maximize the prospect of success of this program and meet the clinical demand for effective RSV therapy, we will diversify the portfolio of anti-RSV candidates by implementing a full-scale drug screening campaign based on the newly established protocol (aim 1). In parallel, the existing leads and, as discovery advances, novel anti-RSV candidates will be mechanistically characterized and their molecular targets identified (aim 2). Candidates with high developmental potential will be subjected to hit-to-lead synthetic optimization guided by in vitro potency, ADME parameters and small-animal pharmacokinetics profiles (aim 3). The efficacy of lead candidates in alleviating key features of RSV bronchiolitis, airway damage, high lung viral load, mucus expression, and pulmonary obstruction, will be assessed in a newly established clinically relevant mouse model of RSV infection (aim 4).',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long term goal is to elucidate mechanisms by which respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes lung dysfunction. In the USA, RSV hospitalizes >100K infants/year. Pulmonary mucus is a hallmark of RSV disease. Mucus mixed with epithelial cell debris blocks the airways. Mechanisms by which RSV infection induces airway mucus are not known. Goals of this proposal are to define the role of the viral fusion (F) proteins of mucus-inducing RSV strains in pathogenesis and to define the roles of neutrophils and basophils in RSV-induced mucus.  In contrast to laboratory RSV strains, RSV strains line 19 and 2-20 induce mucus and bronchiolitis in mice. Using a RSV reverse genetics system, we showed that the F protein of line 19 plays a role in mucus induction. We identified five amino acids in the line 19 F protein as candidates for involvement in mucus induction. We will use F mutant viruses to define line 19 F residues that are important for mucus expression in vivo. RSV 2- 20 is virulent in mice. We hypothesize that RSV 2-20 F contributes to airway mucus and virulence. We will define the role of 2-20 F in pathogenesis using 2-20F-chimeric RSV. Line 19 and 2-20 cause greater epithelial cell cytopathic effect (CPE) and desquamation in vivo than lab RSV strains. We will use F mutants to define effects of RSV line 19 F and 2-20 F on epithelial cell CPE, syncytia, and desquamation in vivo and in vitro. We will define the fusogenicity of RSV line 19, 2-20, and lab strain F proteins in epithelial cells in vitro using a fusion assay. We hypothesize that line 19 F and 2-20 F induce greater syncytia and fusion in vivo and in vitro.  The study will also determine the roles of neutrophils and basophils in RSV bronchiolitis. Concurrently wih epithelial cell damage, RSV line 19 and 2-20 induce neutrophilia in the lungs of mice. We hypothesize that neutrophils contribute to viral clearance and mucus expression in line 19 and 2-20 pathogenesis. Line 19- induced mucus is dependent on IL-13, a TH2 cytokine. IL 4 is the primary TH2-driving cytokine. We showed that basophils are the major IL 4-expressing cell type in RSV-infection. We hypothesize that basophils contribute to RSV line 19- and 2-20-induced IL-13 and mucus expression. These RSV bronchiolitis models will advance our understanding of RSV strain-dependent pathogenesis and may lead to much-needed therapies.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to develop a safe and efficacious virus-like particle (VLP) based-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine to prevent the disease caused by this pathogen. The respiratory illnesses provoked by RSV in infants, children and the elderly are of global economical and public health impact. A recent worldwide estimate [5] indicates that over 33 million children under the age of five suffer RSV associated lower respiratory infections (ALRI) and at least 3 million are hospitalized and approximately 199,000 die of the disease each year. In the US, the CDC estimates that there are over 126,000 RSV associated pediatric hospitalizations at a cost of over $900 million per year. There is no vaccine currently licensed and treatments for the disease are limited; a prophylactic intervention relies on administering a neutralizing monoclonal (Synagis) to infants at risk of infection and to supportive care. A safe and effective vaccine would be the most desirable and cost effective preventive intervention. However, to date the creation of such a vaccine has not been attained and its development hindered by the enhancement of disease provoked by a formalin-inactivated vaccine produced in the 1960's. Other approaches have not proven successful and even dangerous. Here, we propose to develop and test a virus-like particle displaying RSV antigens as a strategy to create a safe and effective RSV vaccine. VLPs are mimics of wild type virus particles but do not contain viral genetic material making them unable to replicate or cause infection. The particulate nature and redundant array of native antigen on the surface of the VLP incites a greater recognition by the immune system. We have successfully produced native RSV-VLPs that display surface spikes and resemble wild type virus. Our RSV based VLP candidate vaccines are created by co-expressing the proteins M, F and SH or M, F or M, F and G as well as additional combinations. The type and magnitude of the immune response they induce as well as the efficacy afforded by the RSV-VLP candidate vaccines will be assessed in animal models. To fulfill these goals, we have designed three specific aims: Specific aim I: Produce and characterize virus-like particles (VLPs) displaying respiratory syncytial virus surface antigens.in alternative compositions F, F+SH, F+G and F+SH+G Specific aim II: Evaluate the immunogenicity (quality and magnitude of the immune response) elicited by the RSV-VLP vaccine and establish safety profile as well as the protective efficacy afforded by alternative compositions of RSV-VLP vaccines in a mouse model of respiratory syncytial virus infection. Selected candidates will be reevaluated by escalating doses of vaccine in mice. Also, initiate development of stable cell lines for the continuous production of the preferred VLP vaccine. Specific aim III: The VLP composition demonstrating efficacy, potency and safety will be retested in the cotton rat model of respiratory syncytial virus infection seeking probe of efficacy in two model of RSV infection. These studies will support a SBIR Phase II proposal and pursue an IND application with the FDA.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a K08 award for Ann Dennis MD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, who is training to become an independent investigator in HIV transmission, epidemiology, and prevention. Despite marked advances in HIV treatment and prevention, new HIV diagnoses continue in the southeastern US where significant disparities still exist among racial minorities and men who have sex with men. Innovative methods are needed to successfully decrease incident HIV infections among these vulnerable groups. The identification of phylogenetic HIV transmission networks or  clusters , which are highly related sequences from individuals with shared HIV transmission, offers unique insight into the structure of HIV transmission on a population level that cannot be obtained through contact tracing or other patient-reported history. Paired with clinical and demographic data, these transmission clusters may provide new targets to direct HIV prevention efforts for groups at highest risk for ongoing transmission. The overall research objective is to characterize local phylogenetic clusters in North Carolina and investigate the use of phylogeny in the public health setting to target future interventions. The proposed study will employ innovative methods in molecular epidemiology to reconstruct transmission clusters using large repositories of HIV pol sequences extracted from antiretroviral resistance testing sent during routine clinical care. The aims of the study are to: ) Identify the temporal and clinical features of emerging or expanding HIV transmission clusters in a large clinical cohort of new and established HIV cases; 2) Assess the effect of higher density sampling of prevalent HIV cases on the detection of transmission clusters and characterize the statewide epidemic structure; and 3) Determine feasibility of incorporating HIV sequence analysis into routine HIV surveillance in a circumscribed geographic area. Dr. Dennis's mentoring team will consist of primary mentor Joseph Eron, MD, Professor of Medicine at UNC with over 20 years of experience in HIV clinical and epidemiologic research. Two co-mentors will offer complementary areas of expertise in HIV epidemiology and phylogenetics: William Miller, MD, PhD, MPH, Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Medicine at UNC whose research focuses on HIV epidemiology; and Stephane Hue, PhD, virologist at University College London, an internationally recognized expert in HIV phylogenetics and UNC collaborator since 2010. Dr. Dennis' training plan links to the proposed research aims: establish a solid foundation in HIV epidemiology including surveillance and outbreak investigation; expand skills in phylogenetic analyses integrating time- scaled and geographic data; and explore ethical issues surrounding phylogenetics in HIV prevention. Training will be accomplished through a combination of didactic courses, workshops, and practicums. These training and research activities will allow Dr. Dennis to mature into an independent investigator and provide a basis foran R01 to implement real-time phylogeny to direct prevention interventions and track trends in HIV incidence.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have demonstrated that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection during infancy is in the causal pathway of the development of childhood wheezing and asthma. Currently, RSV immunoprophylaxis is the only available pharmacologic preventive strategy for severe RSV infection, and is licensed for use only in high-risk infants. Whether prevention of RSV infection during infancy through RSV immunoprophylaxis will reduce the risk of subsequent development of childhood wheezing and asthma is unknown. Specific Aims: We hypothesize that healthy preterm infants with a gestational age of 33 to 36 6/7 weeks will experience a measureable reduction in RSV-attributable healthcare visits after RSV immunoprophylaxis administration, and this reduction will subsequently result in a reduced risk of recurrent wheeze and asthma. To determine whether RSV prevention reduces the risk of asthma, we will 1) demonstrate that healthy preterm infants experience a measurable reduction in RSV-attributable healthcare visits if they receive RSV immunoprophylaxis; 2) determine the effect of RSV immunoprophylaxis on reducing the risk of wheezing in infancy, childhood wheezing between age 2 to 4 years, and childhood asthma by age 6 years. Research Design: We will conduct a retrospective birth cohort study of infants who were born at 33 to 36 6/7 weeks of gestation and were continuously enrolled in an established birth cohort, PRIMA (Prevention of RSV: Impact on Morbidity and Asthma). In Aim 1, the effectiveness of RSV immunoprophylaxis on bronchiolitis healthcare visits during infancy will be analyzed accounting for the temporal relationship between RSV immunoprophylaxis administration and bronchiolitis healthcare visits. In Aim 2, we will determine the effect of RSV immunoprophylaxis on reducing RSV morbidity during infancy and on the development of infant wheezing at 1-year, childhood wheezing between age 2 to 4 years, and childhood asthma by age 6 years. For both aims, propensity score methods will be applied to adjust for confounding by indication (selection) bias, and various sensitivity analyses will be conducted to test the accuracy and the robustness of the effect estimates. Impact: Infant RSV infection represents a ubiquitous and modifiable environmental factor associated with wheezing and asthma, the most common and significant diseases of infancy and childhood. Currently no prevention strategy has been proven effective for these diseases. Palivizumab, the only available prevention strategy for RSV-attributable morbidity, will be off patent and be more affordable soon. The results of the proposed study may demonstrate an effective preventive strategy of a lifelong disease, and thus have significant clinical and public health impact.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT 3: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of respiratory failure in young children and severe RSV bronchiolitis has been identified as risk factor for the subsequent development of asthma in children. Currently, there is no effective vaccine for RSV and pharmacologic treatment is far from optimal. Development of new therapeutic agents is critical to reduce the morbidity and mortality from this important pathogen, and to perhaps modify the risk of childhood asthma. Our preliminary data suggest that prostaglandin (PG) 12 is a novel therapeutic target for RSV. In a well characterized murine model of RSV infection, we reported that transgenic mice that constitutively overexpress PGI synthase (PGIS) were significantly protected from RSV-induced illness. In addition, we found that mice which cannot signal through the PGI2 receptor (IP) had significantly exacerbated weight loss and delayed recovery after RSV infection. Further, in a collaborative study of infants admitted with RSV bronchiolitis, we found that a functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the PGI synthase (PGIS) gene was associated with an increase in the urinary PGI2 metabolite and less severe bronchiolitis. These data strongly suggest that PGI2 and IP signaling protect against RSV-induced disease. The long term objective of this application are to define role of PGI2 in RSV-induced airway pathophysiology and the mechanism by which PGI2 protects against RSV-induced illness. We have isolated an RSV strain (01/2-20) from an infant with bronchiolitis that induced airway responsiveness, airway mucus expression, and high levels of lung IL-13 protein in mice. In aim 1, we hypothesize that PGI2 and IP signaling protects against RSV 01/2-20 -induced airway responsiveness, inflammation, and pathology. We also have preliminary data which reveals that PGI2 selectively downregulates bone marrow derived dendritic cell and macrophage expression of TLR4, a pattern recognition receptor that is activated by the RSV F protein. In aim 2 we hypothesize that PGI2 modulates RSV-induced immunopathology in a TLR4-dependent manner. The proposed studies may result in a novel, effective therapy for RSV bronchiolitis.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies of HIV transmission within populations (i.e., transmission networks) have demonstrated the critical importance of highly connected individuals (i.e., defined by highly related HIV strains indicative of putative transmissions) in sustaining the rate of HIV epidemic spread. The high mutation rate associated with HIV replication provides a nearly unique HIV genetic sequence (i.e., a fingerprint equivalent) in infected individuals resulting in an opportunity to study patterns of transmission network structure. While molecular epidemiologic data are used to track changes in epidemic course and geography, they are rarely (if ever) applied in real time to refocus prevention and treatment interventions to discrete populations or clusters within a population. Because partial HIV-1 pol sequences are generated for routine drug resistance testing, the data necessary to perform molecular analyses are readily available. Paired with appropriate epidemiologic data, network analyses can be used to identify emerging epidemics within groups of individuals related by similar patterns of illicit substance use, drug resistance, sexually transmitted infection, venues f exposure and stage of HIV infection that are appropriate targets for treatment and prevention interventions. Despite the significant public health advantage to using HIV genetic data to study and potentially intervene on real-time network spread of disease, these studies have been limited by fears of loss of privacy related to hypothetical disclosure of potential transmission between two or more individuals. Such disclosure of putative transmission between two or more individuals represents a concern for both consumers and healthcare providers. Unfortunately, no metrics exist to quantify this risk, and no guidelines exist for the use of non-host genetics totarget interventions for infectious epidemics. The lack of guidelines in this sensitive area limitsprogress and research in the molecular epidemiology of HIV. There is an urgent need for guidelines based on both perspectives of the diverse stakeholders and on better definition and quantification of the limits of privacy risk. Our overall goal is to characterize perceptions of privacy risk among stakeholders and reduce uncertainty regarding privacy risk in HIV network analysis. To address the ethical challenges highlighted by the conflict between the public health potential to limit HIV transmission and the need to maximally protect personal healthcare privacy, we propose two Specific Aims: 1) Assess perceptions regarding HIV transmission network analyses. and 2) demonstrate strong quantifiable privacy associated with transmission network analysis. This proposal will be the first to begin framing the risk-benefit ratio for the ue of HIV genetic data used for molecular epidemiologic analyses to target interventions based on HIV transmission networks. The outcomes of these analyses may serve as a foundation for future discussions of genetic investigations of outbreaks and spread of other human pathogens.',\n",

This Project will contribute the first components of an integrated decision support pathway created by the MIDAS Center. It will create new insights in disease transmission patterns, develop innovative statistical and parameter estimation tools and will create a comprehensive high-resolution data resource for the MIDAS Network, policy makers, and the community at large. Specific aims are: 1) acquisition, curation, and integration of new large scale epidemiologic, vital statistics, and demographic data to improve the case-law of infectious disease dynamics, resulting in an essential data resource for modeling; 2) creation of innovative tools for the analysis of spatiotemporal disease transmission patterns, using spatiotemporal statistics and flexible non-linear parameter estimation methods; and 3) inferring individual level transmission dynamics from newly integrated disease data, contact patterns, and genetic data using advanced computational methods. This will result in new knowledge and scientific insight in the impact of pathogen natural history, vaccination, and other factors on spatiotemporal dynamics of distinct childhood infections and also in individual level transmission networks. This Project will shift the paradigm for the study of infectious disease transmission dynamics from ad hoc analyses of specific situations constrained by limited data availability to the systematic exploration of transmission dynamics for a wide range of pathogens and geographies. This Project will build on previous successes of the MIDAS Center to integrate and make available large scale public health datasets and to create innovative non-linear parameter estimation methods.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV is a rapidly evolving pathogen, which results in nearly unique viral genetic sequence in every infected patient. This rapid evolution complicates vaccine design and antiretroviral therapy. However, changes in the genetic sequence can also be used to reconstruct the transmission history of the virus. Phylogenetic approaches have proven useful for understanding the origins, diversification, and worldwide migration of HIV. However, the potential for molecular evolutionary analysis to be utilized for public health goals remains underappreciated and underexplored. Previous work on the nature of HIV transmission networks suggests that individuals in the most highly connected parts of the network have the greatest potential to transmit virus in the future.

In this application, HIV sequences that were acquired during drug- resistance surveillance by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC-DOHMH) will be used to construct the HIV transmission network in New York City. By identifying infected individuals whose viral sequences are highly similar, potential transmission partners can be identified and linked to construct a transmission network. Simulations of intervention (antiretroviral treatment, therapeutic vaccination, pre- exposure prophylaxis [PrEP], etc), targeted at the most highly connected individuals across this network will be performed and compared to simulations of random antiretroviral intervention. The goal of these simulations is to identify network-informed targeted intervention strategies thatcould reduce the incidence of HIV infection. Additionally, simulated clinical preventive trials wil also be performed across the NYC-DOHMH network to develop network-informed metrics, methods, and protocols to test for reduced transmission in a clinical preventative trial. Finally, this same network construction approach will be applied to all publicly available HIV sequences to develop a surveillance tool which will allow other researchers to rapidly determine how their generated HIV sequences fit into the global HIV transmission network. Conclusions. These findings will demonstrate how HIV transmission networks can be used to guide effective treatment strategies, improve clinical trial design, and monitor the progression of the pandemic.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current knowledge of dengue virus (DENV) transmission provides, at best, only a partial understanding of a complicated and dynamic system with a public health track record that has more failures than successes. An important part ofthe problems is that the foundation for contemporary interventions includes a series of longstanding, but untested, assumptions based on a relatively small portion ofthe human population; i.e., people who are convenient to study because they manifest clinically apparent disease. Approaching dengue from the perspective of people with overt illness has produced an extensive body of valuable literature. It has not, however, fully embraced heterogeneities in virus transmission dynamics that are increasingly recognized as key missing information in the struggle to control the most important insect-transmitted viral infection of humans. Only in the last 20 years there have been significant efforts to carry out comprehensive longitudinal dengue studies. Our research team was integrally involved in two prominent longitudinal dengue research projects in Iquitos, Peru and Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand. Our proposed POl represents the next crucial step in this line of inquiry. By studying people across the entire continuum of disease, including people with clinically inapparent and mild infections, we aim to quantify heterogeneities in human variables that affect DENV transmission dynamics and prevention. To do this, we will exploit the infrastructure we assembled over the past 14 years at our Iquitos study area. Our POl aims to help fill the void between understanding transmission dynamics and effective disease prevention by defining, for the first time, the contribution of the understudied majority of DENV infected people (the estimated 294 million with inapparent and mild infections) and the contributions of epidemiological, entomological, and socio-behavioral sources of heterogeneity to the dynamics of DENV transmission. By accounting for factors underlying variation in each person's contribution to transmission we will be able to better determine the type and extent of effort needed to prevent virus transmission and, thus, provide new insights for improved dengue prevention. RELEVANCE (See instructions): An estimated 390 million people in 128 at risk countries experience a DENV infection each year. Dengue viruses cause more human morbidity and mortality than any other arthropod-borne virus. It is the most rapidly advancing vector-borne disease in the world and it serves as a model system for transmission of vector-borne pathogens in general. An improved understanding of DENV transmission dynamics, concepts, and theory will fill critical knowledge gaps and significantly improve disease prevention programs.\",\n",
       " 'Efforts to control dengue virus (DENV) transmission are constrained by the inadequacy of current tools to combat the vectors and virus, and by our limited understanding of the biological, social, and human behavioral dimensions of virus transmission, their heterogeneities and the interactions between them. Heterogeneity is a driver of both biological and epidemiological complexity, and needs to be accurately quantified in order to improve surveillance, generate disease predictions and design science-based interventions. Our underlying hypothesis is that transmission of DENV in urban areas is driven by heterogeneities in movement patterns and infectiousness of humans with a range of disease manifestations, and in opportunities for encounters between humans and mosquito vectors. To test this hypothesis novel theoretical and quantitative analyses will be applied to a unique database derived from diverse empirical field data from this and previous projects through the following three aims. (1) Develop novel conceptual and empirical models that accommodate heterogeneities in human movement in response to disease, mosquito population dynamics and virus transmission. Generated mathematical models will integrate the spectrum of DENV severity (including inapparent infections), individual variations in human mobility and infectiousness, and variations in vector productivity, abundance, and flight dispersal. (2) Quantify epidemiologic patterns of DENV transmission in space and time and derive key parameters for transmission models. Novel statistical techniques will be applied to retrospectively and prospectively collected field data to inform the primary structure of models as well as define their parameterization. (3) Assess the impacts of surveillance and control programs, including vaccination and vector control, on the dynamics of DENV transmission and propagation. Various scenarios to assess the impacts of alternative intervention strategies targeting potential  super-spreaders  and  key locations  of dengue transmission will be simulated through model testing and uncertainty analyses. Of particular interest is the hidden impact of inapparent and unreported mild cases, a potentially key, understudied element in DENV dynamics and control.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) has emerged as a significant global epidemic and poses a particular threat to HIV-infected persons. Drug-resistant TB disease is predominantly thought to develop as a result of selection pressure for drug-resistant mutant bacilli ( amplified resistance ). Drug-resistant TB disease may also occur, however, from exposure to and infection with a TB strain which is already drug-resistant ( primary transmission ). Transmission of drug-resistant TB strains has been well-described in congregate settings, such as hospitals containing highly immunocompromised patients, but few studies have evaluated population-level transmission of drug-resistant TB, and none have done so in a high HIV prevalence setting. The collision of XDR TB and HIV in South Africa offers a unique, early opportunity to study these dual epidemics, which are anticipated to converge in other countries in the future.  The current global crisis of drug-resistant TB is due to both amplified resistance and primary transmission, although the relative contribution of each is unknown. In Aim 1 of this application, we propose a prospective, population-based, cross-sectional study to determine the proportion of new XDR TB cases which develop due to primary transmission as opposed to amplified resistance in Tugela Ferry district, a rural area of South Africa with exceedingly high rates of XDR TB and HIV co-infection. We hypothesize that over three-quarters of XDR TB cases arise due to primary transmission. In Aim 2, we will combine molecular genotyping with contact tracing and social network analysis to provide insights into the relationships between XDR TB subjects with matching strain genotypes ( clusters ) and the locations where TB transmission may be occurring. We expect to identify that transmission is occurring in not only healthcare, but also community congregate settings. The findings from this study will lead to a better understanding of XDR TB transmission patterns in the Tugela Ferry community, which is critical for targeting interventions to curb the ongoing XDR TB epidemic. The proposed study will be the first to integrate epidemiologic, molecular, and social network analytic methods to study TB transmission in a high HIV prevalence setting.  The interactions between HIV infection and drug-resistant TB have been identified as a priority research area by the NIH and the Federal TB Task Force, specifically epidemiologic research and greater use of genotyping to improve understanding of HIV and drug-resistant TB, and implementation of intensive contact tracing and outbreak investigation. This application will address these issues directly and take place at the epicenter of the convergent epidemics of TB, HIV, and drug-resistant TB in rural South Africa, where our research group has been working since 2002. Continuous, population-level surveillance for XDR TB, including culture and drug-susceptibility testing for all TB suspects in Tugela Ferry district, creates a unique opportunity to study XDR TB transmission.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV is primarily transmitted by heterosexual contact and approximately equal numbers of men and women are infected with the virus worldwide. Numerous studies to define the biology of HIV transmission have been undertaken with the goal of identifying stages in the processes from mucosal virus transmission through dissemination to distal lymphoid tissues that can be interrupted by vaccination. To large extent this effort has focused on understanding transmission of HIV to women with little effort define the transmission and dissemination in men exposed to HIV by insertive penile intercourse. We recently developed a reliable model of penile HIV transmission using SIV inoculation of mature male rhesus macaques. This model recapitulates the key virologic and epidemiologic features of HIV transmission in men, i.e. transmission is most efficient in to males when the inoculum is placed into the foreskin rather than simply onto the glans and shaft of the penis; and a single viral variant is found in plasma immediately after transmission (Keele, Miller Unpublished and see Preliminary Studies). We have characterized the virology and immunology of vaginally transmitted SIVmac251 in rhesus monkeys and in this application we propose to conduct parallel studies of penile SIV transmission. The studies will lead to a better understanding of how the HIV is transmitted to males by penile intercourse and the range of antiviral effector mechanisms that are present in the penile mucosal surfaces that are the sites of virus transmission. This information is required to rationally design vaccines to elicit immune responses in the male genital tract that can limit or prevent HIV transmission',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the single most important viral pathogen causing acute lower respiratory- tract infections (bronchiolitis) in children. No vaccine or specific therapy is currently licensed to prevent and treat RSV infections.Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) has been identified as a risk factor for the development of severe RSV infections, yet the mechanisms that determine ETS and infection co-morbidity are largely unknown. Recent studies support the notion that severity of clinical disease is driven by higher level of RSV replication in the airways and studies by our group have shown that expression and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) antioxidant enzymes are significantly decreased in the airways of infants with severe episodes of RSV bronchiolitis, particularly if infants had been exposed to ETS. Surprisingly, our new preliminary data have shown that SOD enzymes are able to inhibit RSV replication in cultured epithelial cells and in experimentally-infected mice. We propose the novel hypothesis that lung SOD enzymes have a previously unrecognized function as host antiviral gene products by limiting RSV replication and shortening viral shedding. Our secondary hypothesis is that expression and antiviral function of such enzymes are reduced/impaired in RSV-infected subjects who are exposed to ETS. In this exploratory project we propose to test these hypotheses by two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, the profile, relative abundance, and activity of SOD proteins will be analyzed in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) of infants with RSV infections of different clinical severity and with or without exposure to ETS. SOD levels and activity will be correlated with the concentration (i.e. viral titer/load) of RSV in NPS. In Aim 2, we will test the specific hypothesis that increasing of SOD activity in the lungs will blunt RSV replication and improve airway disease. For that, we will increase SOD expression in the lung by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene transfer or by the use of salen-based EUK SOD mimetics, and measure RSV titer (as the main endpoint) in an experimental mouse model of RSV infection and co-exposure to ETS. The protective effect of SOD will be evaluated by examining clinical disease, lung inflammation/pathology, and viral-mediated airway hyperresponsiveness. This project may have important translational implications by suggesting new and more aggressive strategies to treat primary respiratory viral infections in high risk infants (i.e. those exposed to ETS). These therapeutic opportunities will b explored in a future R01 application based on the results of this exploratory project.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT 2: Our long-term goal is to elucidate mechanisms by which respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) contributes to asthma pathogenesis. RSV is the leading cause of infant bronchiolitis and a major cause of asthma attacks. RSV is likely involved in asthma development. Severe RSV bronchiolitis in infancy is associated with childhood asthma. Our data suggest that different RSV strains cause differential acute disease severity, both in infants and in experimentally infected mice. Our central hypothesis is that more virulent RSV strains will be tightly associated with early childhood wheezing and asthma development and cause greater epithelial damage, TH2-type inflammation, and airway mucus expression. Our project represents a synergy between RSV molecular epidemiology and mechanistic mouse models of RSV pathogenesis. It is part of a larger study focusing on mechanisms of bronchiolitis-to-asthma in children. The ReSPIRA (Respiratory Study Protection Infection RSV Asthma) cohort will follow 2000 infants until 3-4 years of age. We expect 20-30% of infants will have RSV lower respiratory tract infection (severe), 35-40% will have mild RSV infection, and 35-40% will have no RSV infection detectable. Clinical characteristics of illness will be defined, including a quantitative bronchiolitis severity score (BSS) and prolonged wheezing. We will genotype the approximately 1000 anticipated RSV isolates from the ReSPIRA cohort. We will construct dendrograms to define genetic relatedness of the RSV strains. In collaboration with Dr. Tina Hartert's group (Vanderbilt), we will analyze RSV genotypes and clinical parameters such as BSS and prolonged wheezing to define the role of RSV strain differences in disease seventy and asthma development. We will measure cytokine/chemokine levels in patient respiratory secretions to define how RSV genotypes impact the host response. We will investigate mechanisms of ReSPIRA RSV strain pathogenesis in a mouse model. We hypothesize that different ReSPIRA RSVs will cause differential lung IL 13 and mucus expression and epithelial damage in mice. We will investigate the role of neutrophils in ReSPIRA RSV infection by neutrophil depletion. We will define the role of RSV fusion protein variability in differential pathogenesis using a RSV reverse genetics strategy.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One challenge to understanding and preventing malaria is that people who are infected with Plasmodium parasites, and potentially infectious to mosquito vectors, are frequently asymptomatic, hence not recognized as contributing to transmission dynamics. This research project will determine which people are infected with Plasmodium gametocytes, evaluate resulting mosquito infections that derive from those infectious people, and infer population-level patterns of malaria risk that emerge from these transmission events. We will take advantage of ongoing NIH-funded research (International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research) in southern Malawi where different intensities of transmission occur. Using a new molecular-genetic detection technique (qRT-PCR) for recognizing low-density P. falciparum gametocytes that are not normally seen through microscopy, we will explore associations between infection and symptoms, treatment, age and various environmental/behavioral risk factors. Specifically, we will test three hypotheses addressing 1) the prevalence of parasitemia, and specifically gametocytemia, in relation to transmission intensity and treatment, 2) patterns of gametocytemia with regard to age, mosquito ecology, and anti-malarial interventions, and 3) impacts on household-level transmission to Anopheles vectors. This project is innovative in using a new molecular diagnostic method to evaluate naturally-infected, asymptomatic people combined with non-experimental field transmission to mosquitoes found in common living contexts of the region. We expect our results to have household- and community-level transmission implications for treatment and prevention that may affect the seasonality and annual re-intensification of transmission in ways that are dynamically counterintuitive.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT HIV infection is still a major global health problem. Since the majority of HIV infections occur by sexual exposure, designing a preventive vaccine requires a clear understanding of HIV transmission and local mucosal immune responses. Studies in macaques have shown that a small founder population of SIV-infected CD4+ T cells is established at the site of mucosal transmission. This population expands locally over the first few days with the recruitment of CD4+ CCR5+ target T cells into the cervico-vaginal tissue (CVT). Infection then spreads to the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) where it is fueled by the ready availability of target CD4+ T cells. From there, HIV spreads to other lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues to establish a systemic infection. These initial events are very inefficient, suggesting that the best opportunity to prevent HIV infection is at the site of mucosal entry and before dissemination. Exploiting this early virus vulnerability requires understanding the cellular and molecular requirements for HIV vaginal transmission and dissemination. Further, how the adaptive immune response in the vaginal mucosa influences HIV transmission is not known and is of critical importance for HIV vaccine design. Recent data have demonstrated a role for tissue resident memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells for protective immunity at mucosal surfaces; however, the role of these T cell responses in HIV transmission and immunity is not known. Detailed studies of HIV transmission and mucosal immune responses are not possible in humans. We have found that a model of HIV infection, where immunodeficient mice are reconstituted with human bone marrow, liver, and thymus (BLT mice), recapitulates these early events following HIV vaginal transmission. Using HIV infection of humanized BLT mice, we will test the novel hypothesis that blocking chemokine-mediated CD4+ T cell trafficking will interfere with HIV transmission and dissemination. Further, we will also determine the extent by which the local immune response in the CVT influences HIV transmission. In preliminary studies, we have found that pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of all chemokine-mediated cell trafficking, inhibits HIV dissemination in vaginally challenged BLT mice. Chemokines direct T cell trafficking, and we hypothesize that specific chemokine function controls several aspects of T cell migration required for HIV infection and local immunity. Thus, the major goal of this project is to determine the role of chemokines in the migration of T cells required for HIV transmission and local CVT immune responses. Specifically, we will: (1) Identify the chemokines required for CD4+ and CD8+ T cell recruitment into and migration within the CVT following genital HIV exposure; (2) Determine the role of chemokines in the spread of HIV from CVT to dLNs and the effect of chemokines on migratory behavior of infected T cells once in the LN; (3) Determine the role of chemokines in spread of infection beyond the dLN. This Project is also tightly interconnected with Projects 1 and 2 by studying CD8+ T cell differentiation in HIV infection and the role of PD- 1 in this process with the goal of developing novel strategies to achieve better control of viral replication.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medications designed to diminish the psychologically rewarding effects of methamphetamine (METH) use could offer substantial protective effects for patients trying to cease METH use, especially if these medications could reduce the medical setbacks caused by recidivism. Anti-METH monoclonal antibody medicines that tightly bind METH in the bloodstream and sequester METH away from its site(s) of action in the brain are showing promise as a viable medical therapy. Importantly anti-METH antibodies are non-addicting, long acting and suitable for use in combination with existing behavioral therapies for METH addiction. The aims of this project are to integrate innovative medical breakthroughs in antibody engineering and gene therapy technology, to generate a long-acting antibody-based medicine that will both protect patients from relapse to METH use and minimize treatment failures associated with long-term patient compliance. We will achieve these goals by utilizing adeno-associated virus (AAV) particles to deliver genes encoding high-affinity anti- METH antibody fragments discovered by our research team. We envision that AAV-mediated gene transfer could be used to deliver these purposely designed single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies, which have precise specificity and high affinity for METH. The specific aims include 1) use of molecular engineering techniques to strategically design therapeutic anti-METH scFv medications suitable for packaging the encoding DNA into AAV particles for gene therapy, 2) conduct pharmacokinetic studies of these AAV-scFvs and METH to objectively determine the ability of these AAV-delivered anti-METH antibody fragments to safely and favorably alter METH disposition in rodent models, 3) examine the ability of gene therapy to safely mitigate METH-induced locomotor and cardiovascular effects in rats, 4) determine the efficacy of METH abuse gene therapy in preventing relapse to METH abuse in rat behavioral models. By the end of these studies, we will know if gene therapy can safely deliver sustained doses of antibody medications sufficient to significantly reduce METH pharmacological effects. If successful, these well-integrated approaches could provide a significant medical breakthrough in the treatment options for METH addicted patients.',\n",
       " \"Half or more of HIV transmission events may occur within the period of high infectivity (and often high risk behavior) that can last 11 months or more after a person is initially infected. Unfortunately, neither test-and-treat intervention methods nor Acute HIV Infection projects have found effective ways to intervene against transmission during this risky  recent infection  period.  We seek to develop effective intervention techniques against HIV transmission among drug users and their community members during the recent infection period using a combination of drug injection-, sexual- and social-network-based contact tracing methods; community alerts in the networks and venues of recent infectees; and the logic of going  up  and  down  infection chains. Our first Aim is to develop and evaluate ways to locate  seeds,  defined as drug users and other people who have recently been infected. Our second Aim targets members of seeds' networks and people who attend their venues. We will test them for acute and for recent infection, and alert them to the probability that their networks contain highly-infectious members so they should reduce their risk and transmission behaviors for the next several months to minimize their chances of getting infected. This may also reduce transmission by untested people with recent infection. Community, network and venue education about the need and value of supporting those with recent infection should reduce stigma. Our third Aim is to reduce HIV transmission and to develop new ways to evaluate  prevention for positives  generally as well as our own success in reducing transmission. We will do this using a combination of follow- up interviews and testing, including of viral loads; phylogenetic techniques; and discrete event simulation modeling to assess our effectiveness.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been an increasing appreciation of the importance of environmental pathways for the human-to-human transmission of respiratory, enteric, and other pathogens. These indirect transmission chains may involve water, food, air, and fomites, all of which provide natural points for intervention. There is a need, therefore, to develop transmission models that explicitly describe pathogen dynamics and the dynamics of human contact with pathogens in these environments. We call these environmental infection transmission system (EITS) models. We propose to develop and examine such models across a range of spatial and temporal scales, as determined by agent survivability in different environments and temporal patterns of excretion and exposure. We focus on enteric pathogens as they: 1) exploit a wide range of environmental scales; 2) there exists extensive human and environmental data; and 3) enteric diseases have major global and domestic public health importance. We propose to build upon our work in the past 10 years applying transmission models to microbial risk assessment that has advanced regulatory policy for the USEPA, and more recently through our work in the Center for Advancing Microbial Risk Assessment (CAMRA). Our analyses have included transmission studies in domestic settings such as Cryptosporidium, MRSA, and norovirus in the United States, as well as international settings such as cholera and diarrheal diseases in Haiti, Thailand, and Ecuador. In our work thus far we have examined distinct types of environmentally mediated transmission on a case-by-case basis. Here we will develop a unified framework integrating environmental transmission across a wide range of temporal and spatial transmission scales. Specifically, we propose the following specific aims: 1) To develop an environmental infection transmission systems (EITS) modeling approach that focuses on long timescales, such as waterborne transmission; 2) To develop an EITS modeling approach that focuses on short timescales, such as fomite transmission; and 3) To develop a framework that integrates these diverse transmission pathways that span across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. As many interventions are environmentally driven (e.g. surface cleaning, drinking water and wastewater treatment) this framework will provide detailed environmental insight and guidance for policy and interventions.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is recognized as the single most important viral cause of acuterespiratory disease in infants and young children worldwide. Elderly populations and immunocompromisedindividuals are also at significant risk for serious RSV disease. Despite this very substantial disease burdenimposed by RSV worldwide, there are no vaccines available. Several problems have impeded RSV vaccinedevelopment. First is safety. An early formalin-inactivated vaccine (FI-RSV) predisposed infants to moresevere disease upon natural exposure to live virus resulting in concerns about the safety of all subsequentlydeveloped RSV vaccines, particularly nonreplicating vaccines. A second problem is a lack of understanding ofrequirements for stimulation protective responses making efficacy of new vaccine candidates difficult to predict.A third problem is the failure of RSV infections as well as many vaccine candidates to stimulate long-term,protective immune responses. This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that novel virus-like particle (VLP) RSV vaccinecandidates, unlike any previously tested, may be developed into an RSV vaccine. Published results indicatethat Newcastle disease VLPs expressing RSV glycoproteins are very effective and safe vaccines that stimulatevery durable protective responses in a murine system. This project will further develop these VLPs as RSVvaccine candidates. This project will test the hypothesis that different conformational forms of RSV F proteinimpact the properties of anti-RSV immune responses. The goal is to identify the conformation of RSV Fprotein, expressed on VLPs, that stimulate high titer neutralizing antibodies and protective, long-lived andmemory immune responses and to test the efficacy and safety of selected vaccine candidates in cotton rats.Specific Aim 1: to determine neutralizing antibody titers and levels of protection from RSV challengestimulated in mice by three different second generation VLP vaccine candidates.Specific Aim 2: to assess the safety afforded by selected VLPs after immunization of mice.Specific Aim 3: to assess the safety and protection afforded by a selected VLPs after immunization of cottonrats.',\n",
       " 'The paradigm for dengue virus (DENV) transmission is that mosquitoes feed on viremic humans, become systemically infected, and, after a period of incubation, transmit the virus to a different, susceptible human host during a subsequent blood meal. In assessing transmission potential, measurements of mosquito density and behavior are widely used, but comparatively little is known about the human component of transmission. The goal of this project is to examine how human behavioral responses to DENV infection modify the probability of contact with mosquito vectors in different locations and, consequently, the potential contribution to DENV transmission. We propose a unique and innovative study of the behavioral, perceptual, and clinical responses of individuals across the spectrum of dengue illness, including mild and inapparent infections. We hypothesize that individuals with mild or no illness have lower viremias than those with more severe symptoms, but compensate for this apparent disadvantage in transmission potential by exhibiting higher mobility, leading to greater exposure to mosquito vectors. We will rely on a longitudinal febrile surveillance structure tied to a contact cluster study design (coordinated by the Surveillance Core) to prospectively identify viremic individuals. By applying techniques from our multidisciplinary team of social scientists, clinicians, disease ecologist, and statistician (e.g., focus groups, semi-structured interviews, laboratory testing, continuous monitoring of location and temperature), we will address three Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will describe and quantify the association between perceived disease severity and objectively defined disease classifications (e.g., viremia, AST, WBC, platelet counts, fever, select immunological markers). In Aim 2 we will examine and quantify human behavior change associated with dengue severity, focusing on human movement but including use of anti-pyretics, accessing health care, and other preventive behaviors. In Aim 3 we will quantify individual risk of exposure to Aedes aegypti mosquitoes as a function of movement and disease severity to examine the potential contribution to DENV transmission.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many pathogens are able to infect hosts via the environment without direct contact between hosts. There is a critical need to better characterize environmental transmission in mathematical and computational models used for disease control. Our long term research goal is to develop a quantitative framework to advance disease transmission theory and control of pathogens with environmental pathways and reservoirs. Our central hypothesis is that the suitability of different model formulations for environmental transmission depends on the pathogen life history, the characterization of the environmental reservoir, and the processes associated with pathogen exposure. Using as a case study the transmission of Clostridium difficile in health-care settings, the following specific aims will be carried out: 1) Develop and analyze models that mechanistically address environmental transmission. Explicit functional forms that represent exposure pathways will be developed using queueing theory, and will be linked to the pathogen dynamics outside the host, and implications in disease dynamics will be investigated. 2) Develop and analyze spatially explicit models to address the role of spatial heterogeneity in environmental transmission. Agent-based models (ABM) will be developed to include spatial features of environmental transmission. Their aggregated behavior will be approximated and compared with partial differential equations models. 3) Assess the implications of environmental transmission in disease control and surveillance using optimal control theory. Optimal control will be applied to ABMs to identify the preferred environmental strategies. The project will deliver a comprehensive understanding of the scaling up of environmental transmission, and the suitability of different model representations of environmental reservoirs, transmission, and control strategies that reduce environmental exposure. From a mathematical perspective, the project will address significant mathematical challenges associated to the analysis of ABMs, which are used across all biological disciplines, from molecular biology to ecology, namely how to reduce spatially explicit ABMs to mean-field dynamics, and how to transfer optimal control strategies from the mean-field models to the ABMs.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION: One of the hallmarks of HIV is its extreme mutability, which leads to broad diversification of the viral quasispecies following infection. During mucosal transmission, the virus experiences the opposite phenomenon as well, undergoing a stringent narrowing of genotypic diversity, such that the majority of new infections are established by a single transmitted,  founder  (T/F) variant from the quasispecies. The physical determinants of transmission remain poorly defined. While many studies have traced T/F signature traits to Env, the surface glycoprotein that mediates infection, most have examined the biological consequences of underlying differences without being able to address what specifically differentiates one Env from another because classical methods are poorly suited to analyze structural variation of glycoproteins. The requirements for crystallography make it necessary to truncate and deglycosylate the glycoprotein, removing the very features such as variable loops and glycosylation that make each variant distinct and that can modulate structure within core, conserved regions. We propose to apply novel biophysical and structural approaches to compare the structure of Env glycoproteins from T/F variants of HIV with Env from donor variants using transmission pairs identified in a well-characterized mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) study. We have developed the use of hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to probe intact glycoprotein structure under native conditions. This approach provides the sensitivity and resolution necessary to identify variant-specific differences, producing a fingerprint of local structural order and stability throughout the glycoprotein. In AIM 1, we will apply HDX-MS to analyze Env from matched transmission pairs identified in a Nairobi Breastfeeding MTCT study. The transmission pairs provide a powerful means to pinpoint sequence differences that may be linked with structural and phenotypic differences relevant to transmission of T/F variants. We hypothesize that structural properties in T/F Env may exist including greater stability that confer a selective advantage to T/F variants. We anticipate that greater Env stability may result in complexes that are resistant to inactivation In AIM 2, using infectivity assays, we will test whether T/F variants exhibit enhanced resistance to heat inactivation and inactivation by low pH and lactic acid, factors that may be present at sites of transmission such as the infant gastrointenstinal tract. The combination of structural biology and virological expertise in the Lee and Overbaugh labs applied to examine the matched transmission pairs can provide significant new insights into the physical determinants of virus transmissibility and provide structural details relevant to vaccine immunogen design.',\n",
       " \"The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate novel methods to perform joint inference from combined epidemiologic and genetic data. This inference methodology seeks to provide estimates of fundamental transmission parameters, such as RO, as well as provide estimates of unobserved transmission trees and unobserved counts of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals in the population through time. We focus on two common scenarios. In the first, we target densely sampled, but localized, epidemiologic and genetic data, in which the person, place and time are known, and in which pathogen genetic samples are obtained. These sorts of datasets are commonly generated during transmission studies in households, schools, and similar settings, but also in analyses of novel outbreaks such as SARS or H7N9. Our inference framework seeks to estimate host-to-host transmission networks from combined epidemiologic and genetic data. In the second scenario, we target sparsely sampled, but broader in scope, epidemiologic and genetic data, in which we observe a time series of case reports and sparsely sampled pathogen genetic sequences. In this inference framework, we seek to model population-level transmission processes from a relatively small samples of cases. This framework utilizes coalescent theory to extrapolate from sampled genetic sequences to population-level dynamics. In implementation, we plan to utilize sophisticated inference methodology that combines Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approaches in what's termed particle MCMC (PMCMC). We plan to utilize these novel inference methods to investigate transmission heterogeneity and local transmission structure in influenza, phenomena that have been difficult to fully analyze without a combined epidemiologic and genetic inference framework in place.\",\n",
       " 'Choosing the least-operating cost combination of electric power generation to meet demand is at the heart of utility and Independent System Operator (ISO) functions in the running of an electric power system.  Additionally, utilities and ISOs must ensure that transmission lines will be operated within limits both under normal conditions and in the event of an outage, or failure, of a line.  These transmission limitations can limit the choices available for dispatch of generators.  A generation and transmission system operated within these limits is said to be secure. Maintaining security while seeking to minimize the operating costs of generation is a central function of utility and ISO operations and involves pro-active consideration of the many possible outages that might occur.  If an outage does actually occur, then the dispatch must subsequently be changed so that the system can withstand the next outage.  Generally, however, these actions needed to restore security are not explicitly modeled in the procedures of utilities and ISOs.  The implication is that current systems might be operated in a manner that under-utilizes transmission capacity there resulting in more expensive dispatch than necessary or operated in a manner that could threaten reliability in the event of a single failure.  This work seeks systematic methods to better represent the limitations on transmission and better represent the post-contingency restoration to security so as to improve electric generator dispatch. The graduate students will be trained in electric power engineering, optimization theory, and control systems. Students will be provided opportunities to interact with the Texas Legislative and Public utility commission, and the STEM outreach activities will extend to the South Harlem middle and high schools that serve underrepresented minorities.This proposal aims at improving representation of post-contingency states in Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) and Independent System Operator (ISO) dispatch optimization to better ensure that transmission capability is neither under-utilized nor operated at levels that jeopardize reliability. Improved utilization of transmission capacity will contribute to lowering the overall cost of electricity supply by enabling more of the lower cost resources to be dispatched, and contribute to enhancing the integration of renewable resources by reducing transmission-related wind curtailment. Conversely, in cases where transmission may be operated in an optimistic manner, improved representation of post-contingency states will improve reliability. These improvements will be achieved by more comprehensive dispatch methodologies, that explicitly model post-contingency corrective actions, rather than through costly transmission upgrades.  The capability of the transmission system to support flows of power is typically limited by both continuous and short-term thermal limits due to the interaction of resistive heating of lines and line temperature ratings. The limits vary from line to line and also depend to some extent on ambient conditions. These limits are incorporated into RTO/ISO dispatch models. Standard formulations of RTO/ISO dispatch use security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) that represent contingencies by approximating the post-contingency flows on lines and other elements given a pre-contingency dispatch. Typically, the limits allowed for post-contingency flows reflect short-term transmission limits and are higher than the continuous ratings, with the implicit assumption that the flows can be reduced to being within continuous ratings through (unmodeled) post-contingency corrective actions before the temperature rise on the lines exceeds acceptable limits.  The approach is to utilize recent advances in fine-grain distributed optimal power flow to explicitly represent the trajectory of post-contingency flows into the optimal power flow formulation, so that the implied limit on pre-contingency flows will neither be conservative or optimistic. This will enable better utilization of existing transmission capacity.  Systematic methods to reduce the number of contingency constraints that must be explicitly represented in the optimization will also be investigated.',\n",
       " 'NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components to prepare young scientists for careers in biology and provide them an opportunity to establish international collaborations and take advantage of research facilities and opportunities abroad.  Forging strong international collaborations is mutually beneficial to the U.S. and the foreign hosts.  The fellowship to Carly D. Kenkel supports a research and training plan to investigate the evolution of symbiont transmission mode using reef-building corals as a model system.  The research will advance basic scientific knowledge concerning the evolution of mutualisms and elevate understanding of the coral-algal symbiosis, the foundation of one of the most ecologically and economically important ecosystems on earth.  The host institution is The Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Line Bay.  Training goals include acquiring expertise in novel biochemical techniques, next-generation sequencing methods and bioinformatics analyses. Educational and public outreach activities include establishing a high school internship program at AIMS in collaboration a local school.  This fellowship is being funded jointly by the Office of International and Integratiave Activities and the Directorate for Biological Sciences.Symbioses are ubiquitous in the natural world, yet little is known about how transmission mode evolves in any system.  Reef-building corals are a good system in which to study this question because symbiont transmission mode has diverged repeatedly and recently across coral lineages. This research tests the hypothesis that vertical symbiont transmission (direct transfer of symbionts from parent to offspring) stabilizes mutualistic relationships.  Laboratory experiments use biochemical and physiological assays to quantify resource sharing between coral hosts and algal symbionts in closely related corals with different symbiont transmission strategies. Comparative genomic methods are being used to identify genes involved in the evolution of different transmission modes by looking for signatures of selection.',\n",
       " 'Living in societies affects disease transmission, and understanding how infectious diseases transmit in social settings is a crucial area of research for humans directly, for the animals and plants we use as food, and for the environments we seek to protect. Many settings for disease spread are currently being studied, from schools and workplaces to farms and wild areas. But few systems offer the opportunity to experimentally examine the diverse factors driving disease transmission. Social ant colonies provide a novel experimental approach to manipulate infection and measure disease transmission. In this project, the investigators will seek to understand the role of group size, group complexity, and individual contact networks in driving infectious disease transmission. Historically, linking individual contact patterns with the emergent properties of disease transmission has been limited by logistical constraints. In this research, scientists will use video cameras and ant colonies as a model system to track social interaction networks and follow movement of beneficial, null and pathogenic agents. The project will leverage a general excitement for ants, including public interest in some of their parasites, such as zombie ant fungi, to provide products for diverse stakeholders. These will include comprehensive lesson plans, work modules and experiments on mathematical biology of disease. Videos, computer code, games and statistical packages will also be developed, enabling K-12 teachers and students, university classes, and the broader public, to collect and analyze data on social interactions and pathogen transmission. The Epidemics MOOC (Massive, Open, Online Course) at Pennsylvania State University will disseminate the project to a broad audience. Because the research focuses on understanding the mathematical rules of disease transmission, the results will have direct relevance for humans and provide novel insights into how to manipulate the process of transmission to reduce disease. Ants have a highly evolved social system. Their colonies have agriculture, waste management, air conditioning, aggressive interactions and food limitation. They also are able to effectively control many diseases. Because ant societies are known to optimize the transmission of resources like sugar and protein while reducing pathogen spread, they will serve as a model system for understanding disease transmission. Using epidemiological, spatial and network models, the research will investigate how a range of agents from positive (food) to negative (pathogens) to null (inert beads) are shuttled around the nest. The study of transmission elements that range from beneficial to virulent will allow the establishment of baseline patterns for scaling transmission as a function of colony size and extrinsic conditions (i.e. physical structure) and will shed new light on the role of infectious processes in structuring societies. Although the study of contact networks is often limited to examining a subset of a population (ignoring contacts with unmeasured individuals), some proxy for the relevant contacts that is easier to measure or to the realized transmission network of some pathogen rather than the full network of potential paths, is needed.  The use of video recording within ant nests will allow high-resolution quantification of contacts; thus enabling a comprehensive study of pathogen transmission as an emergent property of societies. The project will include continuous data recorded on thousands of individuals to study the scaling of transmission as a generic process (i.e. independent of pathogens) and link that transmission to the spread of both beneficial and deleterious elements. Using novel dynamic network models and spatial movement models, the important components of social living that promote disease transmission, and those that reduce its spread will be identified. The role of these components will be verified with targeted knockout experiments that will provide specific insights into controlling destructive ant colonies and general insights into the mechanisms behind social immunity and disease control in humans and other social species.',\n",
       " \"Social interactions cause the spread of parasites but it is not known which behaviors are particularly important in the promotion or prevention of transmission events. To answer this question, both the behavior of the host and the spread of the pathogen must be studied. By simultaneously analyzing social data from wild ringtailed lemurs and genetic data from a common gut bacterium, the researchers aim to identify the characteristics of the host and of their relationships that tend to prevent or promote transmission events. This study will provide one of the most direct tests of socially facilitated transmission to date and in doing so, can inform predictive models for the future spread of parasites in human populations. To this end, this study will also employ novel genetic methods that can potentially be widely applied to many questions about the mechanisms of parasite spread.The researchers will examine if and to what extent patterns of association explain the transmission dynamics of an actual bacterial organism by correlating the social interaction network of ringtailed lemurs with incidences of shared haplotypes of E. coli. They will collect data over the course of a year to assess how seasonal shifts in social behavior influence the pattern of shared haplotypes, and to determine the resident and transient nature of E. coli haplotypes across time. Individuals typically harbor a unique resident haplotype, which when found as a transient haplotype in a group member, can potentially inform each individual's role in transmission. The researchers will use E. coli as a model  parasite  because its ubiquity among mammals facilitates the determination of transmission dynamics among all individuals and the extensive knowledge of its genome permits the use of a novel one-locus high throughput sequencing approach that will allow rapid differentiation of many more isolates than is feasible using traditional multi-locus methods. High throughput sequencing methods that target one locus, as proposed here, are currently used in microbiome research to differentiate species or genera of bacteria, but they have not been modified to differentiate strains of a single species. The researchers propose some of the first loci to do this in E. coli. Data from this study will stored on  life.bio  server. All sequence data will be uploaded onto GenBank.\",\n",
       " 'Mosquitoes affect humans through disease, pest issues, and effects on domestic and wild animals. High populations of mosquitoes or the threat of mosquito-borne viruses affect our use of the natural environment, impact tourism, and result in significant spending to mitigate these effects through mosquito control. Vector-borne and directly transmitted viruses pose a significant threat to both human and animal health. Understanding how different processes interact to result in transmission patterns that vary in space and time will improve our ability to predict risk of transmission and develop methods to control disease. The research planned here will explore different components of epidemiological systems, connections between processes occurring at different scales, and how these factors interact to affect risk of transmission. The results will be used to improve modeling of vector-borne disease, by providing better understanding of what processes from one biological scale need to be included in models at other biological scales. For example, how important is a detailed representation of which mosquitoes bite which hosts in an overall understanding of the transmission process? This will allow identification of  weak links , places in the transmission cycle that are sensitive to interference and provide possible means of interrupting the disease transmission cycle and thus improving control strategies and human and animal health.',\n",
       " 'Statement of the problem: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a serious pathogen of sheep, cattle and humans, especially preterm infants and adults. It can lead to secondary bacterial infections with agents such as Mannheimia haemolytica in sheep and cattle and Haemphilus influenza in humans. An innate oxidative defense mechanism, active at the bronchiolar liquid-air interface, unique to higher mammals, consisting of lactoperoxidase (LPO), dual oxidases (Duox1 and Duox2), and a halide substrate (SCN-) produces thiocyanite (OSCN-) which lacks antiviral activity against RSV in vitro. In contrast, iodide (I-) in the form of potassium iodide (KI), when substituted for OSCN- through oral consumption, induces hypoiodous acid (HOI) formation which has potent anti-RSV activity in vitro. Our very recent studies, now being published, clearly show that oral KI reduces RSV disease severity when administered prior to RSV infection (prophylactically). Also, studies by Gerson, et al (6) have shown that inhibition of the Duox/LPO system with the LPO inhibitor, Dapsone, allows increased colonization by a key bacterial pathogen of shipping fever, Mannheimia haemolytica. The extent to which KI therapy can reduce severity of RSV therapeutically (during established infection) has not been determined; nor has the extent to which KI therapy may reduce colonization and disease severity of M. haemolytica alone or in combination with RSV. Hypotheses to be tested: KI administration reduces disease severity of: 1) established RSV infection, and 2) M. haemolytica disease severity with or without concurrent RSV infection. Research plan and expected results: Aim 1 determines the extent to which KI treatment affects RSV disease severity after infection has been established. Aim 2 determines the extent to which KI can reduce M. haemolytica infection with or without concurrent RSV infection. If effective, as expected, the studies will provide a new and inexpensive therapeutic regimen for respiratory disease of sheep, cattle and humans.',\n",
       " 'Plague is a zoonosis that is present in wild rodent populations worldwide and is transmitted primarily by fleas. Yersinia pestis, the plague bacillus, is unique among the enteric group of gram-negative bacteria in having adopted an arthropod-borne route of transmission. Y. pestis has evolved in such a way as to be transmitted during the brief encounter between a feeding flea and a host. A transmissible infection primarily depends on the ability of Y. pestis to grow in the flea as a biofilm that is embedded in a complex extracellular matrix. Bacteria in the biofilm phenotype are deposited into the dermis together with flea saliva, elements which cannot be satisfactorily mimicked by needle-injection of Y. pestis from laboratory cultures. The objective of this project is to identify and determine the function of Y. pestis genes that mediate flea-borne transmission and the initial encounter with the host innate immune system at the infection site in the skin. We study the interaction of Y. pestis with its insect vector by using an artificial feeding apparatus to infect fleas with uniform doses of wild-type or specific Y. pestis mutants. We seek to identify Y. pestis genes that are required for the bacteria to infect the flea midgut and to produce a biofilm that blocks the flea foregut and that is required for efficient transmission. The strategy entails first identifying bacterial genes that are differentially expressed in the flea by gene expression analysis and other techniques. Specific mutations are then introduced into these genes, and the mutants tested for their ability to infect and block the flea vector. Identification of such transmission factors allows further studies into the molecular mechanisms of the bacterial infection of the flea vector. Detailed understanding of the interaction with the insect host may lead to novel strategies to interrupt the transmission cycle.     During FY2014, we continued to investigate the regulation of Y. pestis genes required for the biofilm life stage in the flea vector.  This year we reported that a major bacterial gene regulatory system (known as PhoP-PhoQ) is induced during infection of the flea vector and is required to produce a normal transmissible infection.  Because PhoP-PhoQ upregulates several genes required for bacterial resistance to innate immunity, induction of the PhoP-PhoQ system in the arthropod vector prior to transmission may preadapt Y. pestis to resist the initial encounter with the mammalian innate immune response.  We have completed microarray experiments to compare the in vitro and in vivo (i.e., in the flea) transcriptomes of wild-type and phoP-negative Y. pestis and are now analyzing the data.  We anticipate that PhoP-regulated genes that are involved in development of the transmission stage in the flea will be revealed.  We also continue to investigate the genetic changes that led to the evolutionarily recent transition of Y. pestis to an arthropod-borne transmission route.  Many nonfunctional genes (pseudogenes) occur on the Y. pestis genome; some of them are implicated in regulating the biofilm phenotype that enhances transmission by fleas.  In a 2014 publication we detailed the genetic mechanisms behind the evolution of the flea-borne transmission route of Y. pestis.  Remarkably, only four minor genetic changes- one gene gain and three gene losses- were required.  Restoration of three Y. pestis pseudogenes with the equivalent functional genes of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, the recent ancestor of Y. pestis, eliminates transmissibility from the flea.  Conversely, mutation of these genes in Y. pseudotuberculosis results in the gain of biofilm-forming ability in the flea and transmissibility. In addition, fleas experience acute toxicity and 30-40% mortality after they ingest Y. pseudotuberculosis in a blood meal.  In contrast, Y. pestis is not orally toxic to fleas.  In FY2014 we completed a project that identified the Yersinia urease enzyme as the toxic factor.  All Y. pestis are urease-negative because ureD is a pseudogene; our work indicates that loss of urease activity was positively selected during the evolution of Y. pestis because it increased flea-borne transmission potential.  Thus, gene loss appears to have played a significant role in Y. pestis evolution.     In collaboration with the Genomics Unit of the RML Research Technologies Branch, we are examining and characterizing the transcriptomes of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and our biofilm-producing Y. pseudotuberculosis mutant during growth in vitro and during infection of the flea, with the goal of identifying genes and gene regulatory pathways that are important for flea-borne transmission. The in vivo and in vitro transcriptomic comparisons between these three strains are designed to broadly identify candidate components of biofilm regulatory pathways and other genes important for the recent evolutionary adaptation to flea-borne transmission. Significant differences in the expression of orthologous genes in the flea might be indicative of evolutionary changes in gene regulatory pathways.      We have also further developed models to examine host-parasite interactions in the dermis after transmission by flea bite, and completed a project on the host immune response to flea saliva and how this might influence transmission (in press).     This year we have added a third flea species, the cat flea Ctenocephalides felis, to our studies. We have developed new experimental systems to quantitate the CFUs transmitted by cohorts of fleas as well as individual fleas over a four-week period following a standardized infectious blood meal.  This will allow for quantitative comparison of two mechanisms by which fleas transmit Y. pestis: biofilm-independent early-phase transmission during the first few days after the infectious blood meal and proventricular biofilm-dependent transmission, which occurs from 1-4 weeks after the infectious blood meal. These data will improve mathematical models used to assess the relative importance of the two transmission mechanisms in plague ecology.',\n",
       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and small children. RSV infection in mice is characterized by significant immunopathology which is mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Past studies have suggested that CD8+ T cells with different functional properties and characteristics can be elicited following infection or immunization, and may have differential effects on viral clearance and RSV-associated illness. We have described differences between neonatal and adult CD8+ T cell responses elicited during RSV infection. Differences in clonotype, functional avidity, and other intrinsic parameters of the CD8+ T cell response may help dictate the epitope hierarchy established following infection. We have now defined the dynamics of lung-migratory dendritic cell populations in the lung and lung-draining lymph nodes of RSV-infected mice during early life as compared to adulthood and have determined lung dendritic cell populations that induce RSV-specific adaptive T cell responses following infection. These dendritic cells were found to induce T cell responses in an age-dependent manner, and we have implicated lower costimulatory molecule expression by neonatal dendritic cells as one mechanism for this difference. Our work in the last year has been greatly aided by the development and characterization of three strains of transgenic mice with CD8+ T cells specific for RSV.  Co-culture of transgenic CD8+ T cells of different specificities with dendritic cell populations has allowed us to measure their ability to induce T cell responses in both an age and epitope-specific manner.  In the last year, we have initiated studies using MCMV vectors to induce RSV-specific T cell responses.  This will allow us to look at T cells elicited during chronic infection and better understand their contribution to clearance and/or immunopathology following RSV infection.  Continued work on this study will fully characterize CD8+ T responses to RSV, elucidate important factors that dictate the type of CD8+ T cell response that is generated, and help understand how other cell types regulate the CD8+ T cell response in an age-dependent fashion.',\n",
       " \"The LID is developing live attenuated vaccines against RSV, HPIV3, HMPV, HPIV1, and HPIV2 (in decreasing order of importance). Our emphasis is on RSV, although we have clinical studies in progress for most of these viruses. These vaccines are developed and produced from cloned cDNAs using reverse genetic systems of our making and employ defined attenuating mutations of our making. We develop candidates in pre-clinical studies and prepare vaccine seeds. Vaccine manufacture is performed under contact under our supervision, and clinical evaluation is performed by contract or collaboration under our supervision. Vaccines are evaluated clinically beginning in adults (who are seropositive for these common viruses), and moving successively to seropositive older children (typically 12-59 months of age) followed by seronegative younger children and infants (typically 6 -24 months of age for RSV, 6-59 months of age for the others). For RSV and HPIV3, viruses may be evaluated further in virus-naive young infants 1-3 months of age. Adult studies are open-label, whereas pediatric studies are double-blind placebo-controlled with a 2:1 ratio of vaccine to placebo recipients. For all RSV studies, subjects are followed during the subsequent RSV season (Nov 01  March 31) following the experimental immunization in order to assess the longevity of the antibody response and the rate and severity of natural RSV infection (although these studies are too small to reliably assess protective efficacy), and to confirm the absence of enhanced RSV disease. Since 2006, these clinical development activities have been supported in part by a CRADA with MedImmune.RSV vaccine: RSV has two antigenic subgroups, A and B, that have extensive cross-reactivity and cross-protection. We presently are focusing on RSV-A, the more important of the two. A subgroup A-based RSV vaccine may prove to be sufficiently cross-protective against RSV-B. If not, an RSV-B-based candidate can be developed based on the results with RSV-A.We previously made an RSV vaccine candidate called RSV delM2-2 that is based on deletion of the ORF encoding the M2-2 protein. This mutation provides up-regulation of antigen synthesis that may increase immunogenicity. In addition, deletion of a gene or ORF should be refractory to reversion or compensation, thus providing increased genetic and phenotypic stability. We have been conducting a phase I clinical study (NCT01459198) of a version of this mutant whose seed virus was supplied by MedImmune and is called RSV MEDI delM2-2. This candidate was highly restricted and well tolerated in adults and seropositive children. We have just completed evaluation in 30 seronegative children 6-24 months of age, and data analysis is still in progress. The vaccine appeared to induce reasonably strong antibody responses. The subjects in this study happened to have an unusually high incidence of adventitious infections by other respiratory viruses during the study period, which confounded evaluation of tolerability. Therefore, we are initiating a second phase 1 study in 51 additional seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT02040831), which is expected to begin in 2014. This study will use a version of the delM2-2 virus that was derived in our laboratory and is called RSV LID delM2-2. Part of this study will be done in collaboration with the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group.We previously developed another RSV candidate called RSV cps2 that contains a series of point mutations and deletion of the SH gene, and which is highly temperature-sensitive. RSV cps2 is presently in a phase I study in seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT01852266). This study involves 51 subjects; enrollment is expected to be completed in July, 2014, and the RSV surveillance period will be completed in March, 2015. Part of this study is being done with IMPAACT.We also previously developed another RSV vaccine candidate called RSV delNS2del1313. This virus contains the deletion of the nonstructural protein-2 (NS2) gene, which encodes a protein that antagonizes host responses to viral infection, notably the type I interferon (IFN) response. It also contains deletion of codon 1313 in the polymerase L protein. This virus was shown to be suitably attenuated in seropositive children 12-59 months of age, and presently is being evaluated in 30 seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT01893554). Enrollment is underway (as of July 2014).Thus, we have three promising RSV platforms in or entering phase I studies: delM2-2 (two versions), RSV cps2, and RSV delNS2del1313. These viruses have different properties (such as temperature-sensitivity and differences in antigen expression) and different mechanisms of attenuation (involving effects on RNA synthesis, regulation of RNA synthesis, IFN antagonism, among others). Our goal is to expeditiously identify a suitable live attenuated RSV candidate to bring forward into larger studies.HPIV3 vaccine: We have completed phase I evaluation of an attenuated version of HPIV3 called rHPIV3cp45. This is a recombinant version of a biologically derived cold-passaged (cp) virus that previously had been shown by LID and collaborators to exhibit satisfactory infectivity, safety, immunogenicity, and lack of transmissibility in seronegative infants and children in phase I and II studies. LID re-derived this virus from cDNA to provide a known pedigree for safety reasons. This virus was evaluated in a phase I clinical study in seronegative children 6-36 months of age in which two doses were given at a 6-month interval to investigate the durability of immunity and the feasibility of boosting at this interval (NCT01021397). Part of this study was done as companion protocols through Seattle Children's Hospital and IMPAACT. The results confirmed the equivalence of the cDNA-derived material with the previously-studied biologically-derived material. In addition, the results showed that the second dose induced an immune response in the few individuals who did not have a response to the first dose, and it boosted immunity in those who had a suboptimal response to the first dose. This is an excellent HPIV3 vaccine candidate that can advance to larger studies. It also is available to be combined with an attenuated RSV vaccine to create a bivalent vaccine, and indeed we previously showed that such a combination was compatible with regard to tolerability, replication, and immunogenicity of the two components.  HPIV1 vaccine: We previously developed an HPIV1 vaccine candidate called rHPIV1-C(R84G/del170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) that includes mutations that were engineered for genetic stability. Evaluation in adults and seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age showed that this candidate is highly attenuated. A phase I study in seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (NCT00641017) showed that this virus is over-attenuated. These results provide a benchmark between pre-clinical assays and replication in humans. Over-attenuation can be corrected by reverse genetics. HPIV2 vaccine: We previously developed an HPIV2 vaccine candidate called rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/1724 that includes stabilized mutations. This virus was highly attenuated in adults. Presently, it is being evaluated in a phase I study in seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age (NCT01139437). HMPV vaccine: We previously developed an HMPV vaccine virus called rHMPV-Pa in which the HMPV P gene was replaced by that of avian MPV, thus conferring a host range attenuation phenotype. Evaluation in adults and seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age showed that it is highly attenuated. The vaccine is presently being evaluated in seronegative children 6-59 months of age (NCT01255410).\",\n",
       " 'Malaria Immunology and PathogenesisGoals are:1) To understand how Malian children with hemoglobin S, alpha-thalassemia, G6PD deficiency, and ABO polymorphisms are protected from Plasmodium falciparum malaria; 2) To develop a profile of the acquisition of malaria immunity in Malian children;3) To examine aspects of pathogenesis due to malaria in Malian children and adults;4) To characterize the pharmacokinetics of artemisinin (ART) and the mechanisms of parasite clearance after drug treatment. To initiate these investigations, we conducted a 4-year longitudinal study of 1500 children ranging in age from 6 months to 18 years living in 3 villages in Mali (the Kenieroba study). One major effort is to determine the relative protection against malaria conferred by different red blood cell (RBC) polymorphisms, and all the enrolled children have been typed for a series of these polymorphisms. After diagnosis and treatment of 4207 episodes of malaria, we have developed a very detailed profile of age-dependent acquisition of resistance to malaria in this population. We have shown that sickle cell trait (HbAS) confers greater protection against malaria than other RBC polymorphisms.  We are continuing to investigate the mechanistic basis for this protection:1) We identified a sub-cohort of children, selecting those with sickle cell trait (HbAS) and pairing them with age-matched HbAA controls, and we obtained plasma and cell samples for 3 years from this group. We have found that antibodies to a variety of merozoite proteins are lower in the HbAS children so that this is not the basis for their resistance;2) We developed a plasma reactivity assay using flow cytometry to measure antibody binding to infected red cells and showed that HbAS children do not display increased reactivity to the red cell surface; 3) In 2014  we have extended this work in two collaborative studies. We are evaluating the ability of sera from these children to limit parasitemia using an antibody-dependent respiratory burst assay (ADRB) and also a parasite opsonization assay. Results from both these assays are being correlated with protection from malaria infection in the children.Some children with malaria display severe pathology, but it has been unclear as to whether certain P. falciparum strains elicit more pathology or whether aspects of the host genetics or responses contribute to susceptibility. We are conducting a series of studies related to pathology during malaria including: 1) Reactivity of sera from adult males and females from Mali to various domains of a particular PfEMP1 protein, VAR2CSA, which has been implicated in pregnancy associated malaria. We have explored a major host effector function  opsonization of parasitized red cells expressing VAR2CSA on the surface. We have completed and published this work in 2014 using reversal of opsonization as a novel application of the assay. Using this assay we have identified several domains within the VAR2CSA protein which are particular targets of opsonizing antibodies in multigravida Malian women; 2) We have continued to assess the in vitro and in vivo responses of Malian children to artesunate (ART), an effort prompted by reports from Asia of slow clearance of P. falciparum infections. We have not yet found this resistant phenotype but we are continuing to study the mechanisms by which parasites are cleared from the blood after treatment with ART and to investigate the role of anti-parasite antibodies in this clearance. Malaria Transmission Transmission of malaria is a critical aspect of the parasite life cycle but is poorly understood, so that we have increased our efforts to investigate parasite sexual stages and transmission in the field. In May of 2014 we completed a clinical protocol studying 500 individuals of all ages in Kenieroba. Volunteers were finger-pricked twice per month for a year and sera were collected by venipuncture three times during the year. Fingerprick samples collected will allow analysis of both DNA and RNA. This year we have developed protocols for analysis of parasite DNA by PCR directly on filter paper and we are applying these to all the samples. In addition, we have established methods for quantitation of gametocyte mRNA encoding Pfs25 using RT-PCR with the RNA samples. Thus we can identify both carriers of asexual and sexual stage parasites.  These profiles will be compared throughout the year and correlated with age and area of residence. Selected serum samples will be tested for the capacity to inhibit transmission in membrane feeding assays to determine whether those living in endemic areas develop antibodies that can block transmission. Strategies to impact malaria transmission will be accelerated by a better understanding of those individuals primarily responsible for transmission to mosquito vectors. P. falciparum and evasion of mosquito immune systemWe had obtained experimental evidence that some African strains of P. falciparum can evade the mosquito immune system resulting in more effective transmission.  Using a combination of QTL mapping and linkage group selection, we identified Pfs47 as the malaria gene that allows the parasite to infect mosquitoes without being selected for destruction.  In Africa the Pfs47 gene is highly polymorphic.  We are testing the general hypothesis that Pfs47 has to interact with a mosquito gene to disrupt the immune response and be transmitted more effectively, and that different alleles of Pfs47 work better to evade the immune system of certain mosquito vectors.  If this hypothesis is correct, we expect that the different mosquito vectors in Africa will preferentially transmit parasites with certain alleles of Pfs47.  The team in Mali is collecting mosquitoes from homes using the  spray-catch  method and doing ELISA assays to identify P. falciparum infected mosquitoes.  Material from infected mosquitoes has been sent to NIH and we are extracting the genomic DNA, sequencing the Pfs47 gene and doing molecular genotyping of the mosquito vector.  We received a total of 212 mosquito samples sent from Mali, collected during the 2010-2011 season. We sequenced the Pfs47 D2 domain (the most variable region) in 150 samples, and found that 111 mosquitoes had single P. falciparum infections, while 39 were infected with more than one parasite. We identified 11 haplotypes (based on the D2 domain sequence) in mosquitoes with a single infection and two of them were the most frequent, representing 55 and 18% of the samples.  Regarding the temporal distribution of the 11 haplotypes, the largest diversity of haplotypes was found in the month of October.  With our current sample size, we did not find a significant difference in the frequency of Pfs47 haplotypes between M-form and S-form A. gambiae mosquitoes.  Malaria VectorsPreviously our main efforts focused on (1) long distance migration of mosquitoes as means of re-colonization of Sahelian villages after population extinction, and (2) finding hidden shelters of African malaria mosquitoes during the Sahelian dry season. This work has expanded to become an independent project in 2014. We have also assisted Dr. Patrick Duffy and his LMIV associates who are working on clinical trials of a transmission blocking vaccine candidate. These studies require an insectary and mosquito feeding expertise in order to evaluate the functionality of antibody responses to the vaccine and we have supported Dr. Duffy and LMIV in this work. Sand fly / Leishmaniasis Program The program on leishmaniasis and its sandfly vectors is designed to describe the unexamined epidemiology of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Mali. Previously we showed that Leishmania major, the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis, was the only parasite species found in sandflies, and that Phlebotomus duboscqi is the principal vector.',\n",
       " 'The research program of the Virus Ecology Unit (VEU) is focused at understanding the drivers of virus emergence. Although tremendous progress has been made over the last decade in prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, prophylactic or therapeutic options are not available for most emerging and newly emerging diseases, or would not easily become available to resource poor areas where these outbreaks often occur. Currently, our best hope to prevent or intervene in future outbreaks of most emerging viruses lies in the potential to efficiently block cross-species, zoonotic and human-to-human transmission. The main objectives of the VEU research program aim at the identification of the underlying biotic or abiotic changes in virus-host ecology that allow these emerging viral pathogens to cross the species barrier. Recognizing both the strengths and weaknesses of a unilateral focus on field research on one hand and experimental research on the other, we set out to combine the best of both approaches in one research program, where we aim to identify drivers of cross-species transmission from data gathered in the field and model these drivers under experimental conditions in the lab.For a wide variety of novel emerging infectious viruses (e.g., Nipah virus, Ebolavirus, MERS-CoV), no prophylactic or therapeutic intervention strategies are currently available to prevent or contain outbreak events10. In addition, very limited information is available on the route of zoonotic and human-to-human transmission for most of these viruses. Currently, our best hope to prevent or intervene in future outbreaks of these viruses lies in the potential to efficiently block transmission and thereby spread of the outbreak. In order to efficiently establish prevention strategies, detailed knowledge on mechanisms of pathogenicity and transmission (contact transmission, fomite transmission, aerosol transmission, foodborne or vertical transmission) in the context of abiotic (temperature, humidity, airflow) and biotic (routes of transmission, immune status, receptor distribution, amount of shed virus) factors is needed. A more comprehensive understanding of transmission events is likely to make an important contribution to the control of emerging zoonotic infections.',\n",
       " 'The studies that assess malaria transmission blocking assays and gametocyte carriage rates in Bancoumana, Mali (NIAID Protocol 11-I-N143) have continued, and this year an additional modality called Experimental Huts was implemented to measure transmission in wild-caught mosquitoes.  The study completed enrollment of 250 children and adults in July 2011, and has now been extended through this year.  Participants are followed monthly to determine parasite carriage rates.  Some gametocyte positive volunteers participate in mosquito feeding assays (direct skin feeds; membrane feeds; Experimental Hut studies) to provide data on parasite transmission to mosquito using various laboratory methods. Vaccines that block transmission of malaria to mosquitoes have the potential to be critical tools in the drive to eliminate or eradicate malaria.   Clinical development of such vaccines requires expertise in vaccinology, parasitology, and entomology, which is continuously being developed and strengthened as part of this collaboration.  Assays to estimate the potential benefit of these vaccines need to be standardized and validated in malaria exposed populations.  Baseline data from this protocol was used to plan for the first ever field trial of a transmission blocking vaccine, which was initiated in 2013, and is continuing into the 2014 season.   The Phase 1 clinical protocol (13-I-N109) for Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel transmission-blocking vaccine trial continues at the Bancoumana site. After a dose escalation trial in the US determined this to be a safe and immunogenic vaccine, vaccinations were initiated in Bancoumana and surrounding villages in May 2013. The vaccine is given at 0, 2, and 4 months, after which transmission-blocking activity was assessed during the ensuing malaria season. A 4th and final dose will be given in Sep 2014 after which transmission-blocking activity will again be assessed during the 2014 transmission season. The DSMB review in 2014 has deemed the vaccine product sufficiently safe and immunogenic based on ELISA data to continue the study. The primary goal of the trial is to assess safety, and the primary measure of vaccine activity will be measured by performing direct skin feeds of mosquitoes on all volunteers each week for 6 weeks after the 4th vaccine dose.The LMIV epidemiologic study of malaria infection and disease in Malian infants and pregnant women continues in Ouelessebougou, Mali. This study has thus far enrolled nearly 1900 pregnant women as well as their newborns after delivery, and also several hundred children under 5 years of age, for longitudinal followup. Data are being collected on the frequency of clinical malaria and asymptomatic parasitemia, and samples are being collected for immunoparasitologic and host factor analyses, to determine the molecular bases for malaria pathogenesis and immunity. Our results thus far show that pregnancy malaria increases the risks of stillbirth and premature delivery, as well as the risk of malaria in the offspring. The results from these studies have been submitted for 2 presentations at the ASTMH meeting in Nov 2014.During FY14, the ICER/MRTC facilities in the village of Doneguebougou were upgraded to support whole organism vaccine trials. A Phase 1 trial of the PfSPZ Vaccine product developed by Sanaria, Inc, was initiated in Jan 2014 to assess its safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in a naturally exposed Malian populations. This is the first-ever field trial of a whole organism vaccine. All 5 doses of the vaccine have been administered, and the study participants are now being followed to assess the degree of activity that the vaccine has to prevent infection with naturally circulating wild-type parasites in Mali.Clinical Laboratory. During FY12, the clinical lab transitioned to a core facility to support other DIR activities at MRTC. During FY14, LMIV studies continued as the major customer and supporter for the clinical laboratory, and the clinical laboratory is currently supporting all the studies listed here including the Phase 1 clinical trials. This is the first clinical lab in West or North Africa to achieve CAP certification.  Quality assurance processes are ongoing, and certification is actively maintained.  Immunology Laboratory. During FY14, LMIV supported the efforts of DIR to establish a new core Immunology lab, drawing from the staff and facilities that previously supported HIV and TB studies. We successfully integrated the new core activities into our vaccine trials, for purposes of processing and storing PBMC samples. This interaction has expanded the assay expertise in the immunology lab, and has also given the lab experience in supporting a Phase 1 interventional trial, which is new to the group.Over the past year, we convened the second West African Regional Training Workshop on Protozoan Pathogens for young scientists. The workshop brought together 22 young scientists from across the west African region, together with a west African and international faculty. The theme of the 2-week workshop was Infection of the Pregnant Host, and emphasized hands on activities, journal clubs, student participation, and research proposal development. The feedback from the young scientists about the quality of their experience and knowledge gained was uniformly very high.',\n",
       " 'Studies on asexual stage immunity to P. falciparum 1. Search for conserved, parasite-encoded epitopes on the surface of malaria IEs  Pregnancy associated malaria (PAM) remains a major threat to women and their unborn children in endemic areas. IEs accumulate in the placenta and the ensuing inflammatory response can increase the likelihood of anemia, hypertension, premature delivery and possible death of low birth weight infants. Clinical immunity to PAM in multigravid women has been attributed to antibodies that recognize VAR2CSA, a large multi-domain variant of the PfEMP-1 family, which binds to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), on the surface of red cells. Opsonization of infected erythrocytes by cytophilic antibodies that recognize VAR2CSA epitopes represents an understudied host effector mechanism in PAM. We have established a flow cytometry-based opsonization assay and we have shown that, in contrast to malaria-nave American adults and malaria-exposed Malian men, purified IgGs from multigravid Malian women showed higher 1) reactivity to recombinant DBL domains by ELISA, 2) binding to red cells expressing VAR2CSA, and 3) opsonization of these infected erythrocytes by human monocytic cells. Importantly, preincubation of IgGs from multigravid women with selected VAR2CSA domains significantly diminished opsonization of VAR2CSA-expressing IEs by monocytes. Antigen reversal of opsonization provides the first evidence that domains DBL3x, DBL5&#949;, and DBL2x, are the primary targets of these opsonizing antibodies. Our study focuses attention on these domains for PAM vaccine development and introduces a new tool to identify targets of host effector responses to pathogens.2. Investigate targets of merozoite immunitya. AMA1 -While AMA1 is a prominent vaccine candidate, it has two issues:1) antigenic polymorphism so that antibody responses tend to be strain-specific and 2) insufficient antibody production to result in protective immunity in humans. Our data as well as that of our collaborators supports the use of a mixture of 4-5 different AMA1 alleles to overcome the polymorphism and elicit broadly reactive antibodies. Further, we have collaborated with LMVR investigators to show that using AMA1 in conjunction with its partner protein RON2 produces antibodies with greater activity in a standardized parasite growth inhibition assay (GIA). This complex is required for triggering junction formation between the merozoite and the red cell surface. Evaluation of this combination in an immunization-challenge trial in a non-human primate (Aotus) is ongoing to obtain supportive data for a human clinical trial.b. We continue to work with other investigators on two different merozoite protein families - the reticulocyte binding-like family (RBL) and the erythrocyte binding-like (EBL) proteins as novel candidates either as single proteins or as mixtures. We have collaborated with others from LIG to show that antibodies to RH5 isolated from those living in Mali do have GIA activity, lending support to this protein as a new vaccine candidate. Also we have evaluated the GIA activity of antibodies to both RH5 and the RIPr protein (RH5 interacting protein) which appear together on the surface of the invading merozoite. Each protein elicits strong GIA activity.3. Studies of immunity to malaria in Kenieroba, Mali. Our 4-year investigation of the acquisition of immunity to malaria in Malian children represents perhaps the most detailed longitudinal  study of malaria in African children, and it reveals the impact of the sickle cell trait (HbAS) in protection against malaria. We have evaluated antibody responses of these children in several different assays including ELISA and GIA, and in 2014 we are adding other functional measures such as the neutrophil-dependent antibody-dependent respiratory burst assay and opsonization assays to obtain a broad scope of anti-parasite functional activities.Studies on parasite sexual stages and malaria transmission:1. Develop quantitative methodology for analysis of the standard mosquito membrane feeding assay (SMFA) to evaluate transmission blocking activity and extend this to parasites in the field. The gold standard assay to evaluate the ability of antibodies to block transmission to mosquitoes is the SMFA, and we have performed an in depth study of this assay to define its characteristics.  We have shown that the SMFA is quite reproducible at high concentrations of antibody but highly variable at low concentrations and we have worked with the Biostatistics group at NIAID to develop a computer model of the assay. In 2014 we have worked with others at LMVR and at FDA to develop improved read-outs for this assay.2. In 2014 we used the SMFA assay to assess whether children immunized with the RTS,S vaccine (the most advanced malaria vaccine candidat) could develop antibodies that would block transmission. We were not able to show an impact of the polyclonal human or monoclonal antibodies on transmission to mosquitoes whether measured by reductions in oocyst density or sporozoites in salivary glands.3. Search for and evaluate new possible transmission blocking vaccine candidates. Using SMFA in 2014 we have evaluated a number of potential transmission blocking vaccine candidates as well as different presentations of these antigens. In collaboration with colleagues at Oxford University we have produced and tested a number of known and unknown sexual stage proteins from P. falciparum. These proteins have been produced in HEK293 cells and the products were used to immunize mice. Sera from these animals are being evaluated in the SMFA.4. Assess the presence of asexual and sexual stage parasites in Kenieroba residents throughout the year. In the spring of 2013 we initiated a new study (NIH 13-I-N107) of malaria transmission in Kenieroba to address the limited information on actual transmission in malaria endemic areas, and in 2014 we completed the field aspect of this study. Volunteers were finger pricked twice per month for 1 year to collect DNA and RNA. During this year we have worked out the methodology for the PCR to detect parasite DNA on filter papers and also the RT-PCR procedure to identify RNA specific for gametocytes. Using these techniques, we are evaluating the carriage of parasite DNA as well as gametocytes in 500 villagers of all ages. This will identify those individuals capable of malaria transmission who might be targeted for intervention. 5. Determine whether Kenieroba, Mali residents develop antibodies which have blocking activity in SMFA. The Kenieroba study of transmission includes a venipuncture sample from all the volunteers 3 times during the year. These larger volume serum samples will be used in SMFA to determine whether antibodies have transmission blocking activity. 6. Determine the relationship between the SMFA assay and the DMFA, which measures the transmission blocking activity of antibodies to sexual stage parasites from infected people in the field. We are evaluating whether models that we have developed that work with SMFA are also applicable to DMFA.Other studies: 1) We have collaborated with Dr. Akhil Vaidya of Drexel University in showing that asexual P. falciparum parasites do not require synthesis of heme, but it is necessary for sexual stage differentiation and infection of mosquitoes; 2) In collaboration with Dr. Olivier Lichtarge at Baylor University we have provided supporting data for a new strategy to identify function of unknown genes(supergenomic network compression) and have aided evaluation of PfEXP1  as a glutathione transferase which can be inhibited by artesunate;3)We continue to work with Drs. Amy Bei and Dyann Wirth to profile the changes in P. falciparum clonal frequency in Senegal and the influence of immune responses on that process.',\n",
       " 'Current antivirals can control but not eliminate hepatitis-B-virus (HBV), because HBV establishes a stable nuclear cccDNA. Interferon-&#945; treatment can clear HBV but is limited by systemic side effects. IFN-&#945; is known to exert transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic antiviral effects on HBV. We study how interferon-&#945; can induce specific degradation of the nuclear viral DNA without hepatotoxicity and propose lymphotoxin-&#946;-receptor activation as a therapeutic alternative. Interferon-&#945; and lymphotoxin-&#946;-receptor activation up-regulated APOBEC3A and 3B cytidine-deaminases, respectively, in HBV-infected cells, primary hepatocytes and human liver-needle biopsies. HBV-core protein mediated the interaction with nuclear cccDNA resulting in cytidine-deamination, apurinic/apyrimidinic site formation and finally cccDNA degradation that prevented HBV-reactivation. On the other hand, genomic DNA was not affected. Our data indicate that cccDNA degradation is possible and can be induced without side-effects on the infected host cell. An important task will be testing of combinations of nucleos(t)ide analogues with novel anti-viral strategies (e.g. LT&#946;R agonists or adoptive T-cell therapy) to activate A3A or A3B to cure hepatitis B. Thus, inducing nuclear deaminases e.g., by lymphotoxin-&#946;-receptor activation allows development of new therapeutics that, combined with existing antivirals may cure hepatitis B.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       ABSTRACT: Objectives: The main objectives are to identify strategies to purge the hepatitis B virus (HBV) reservoir to permit the discontinuation of anti-HBV therapy for life. We will identify new antiviral agents and combined modalities to target reduction or elimination of cccDNA by disrupting HBV core protein concentration [Cp], which together with viral polymerase inhibitors could provide preclinical data towards the potential eradication of HBV, eliminating the need for lifetime chronic treatment. Research Plan: To test a focused library of novel heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAP) in both hepatic cells along with a novel primary cell system in search of a novel therapeutic agent to alter capsid assembly and disrupt HBV covalently closed-circular DNA (cccDNA). This novel and original cell based assay can also be used to select for resistant viruses, which until now has not been possible. Methods: We have discovered a novel non-toxic nanomolar capsid inhibitor for HBV that we will evaluate further and optimize. We will also design and synthesize novel chemical derivatives and determine their physico-chemical properties of capsid assembly as well as the resultant changes in [Cp], and assess their in vitro cytotoxicity, resistance profiles, selection for resistant mutations, and in ivo efficacy and in combination regimens. Clinical Relevance: Current oral anti-HBV therapy does not cure, requiring costly lifetime therapy to suppress virus. Our novel approaches target the HBV cccDNA that is associated with viral persistence in HBV-infected hepatocytes, potentially eliminating the major HBV reservoir leading to a sustained virological response or cure.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Infectious complications following hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) are a significant healthcare problem. HCT patients are at increased risk for developing severe respiratory infections, of which respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is among the most common. In the general population, infection with RSV is common, with nearly everyone infected by three years of age. However, protective immunity to RSV is incomplete, in that infections throughout life are commonplace. In immunocompetent adults, these typically present with symptoms similar to the common cold (rhinovirus). In transplant recipients, on the other hand, lower respiratory tract infection with RSV is a significant cause of death. In the proposed studies, we will test a new method to manage respiratory infection in the early post-transplant period. For several years, we have been developing nasally administered, inactivated viral vaccines against respiratory viruses, including RSV. No licensed vaccine currently exists for RSV, and therapeutic options are less than optimal. Hematopoitic cell transplant (HCT) patients are an ideal patient population to serve as an initial target population for RSV vaccination. First, HCT patients are at highest risk for respiratory infection with RSV for a relatively short time period after transplant. Thus, a successful vaccine would not necessarily need to provide long-term protection. Second, even a small improvement in immunity to RSV is likely to be of clinical benefit. Third, vaccination of immunologically experienced adults is unlikely to lead to  vaccine- enhanced disease  associated with formalin-inactivated RSV vaccines in the 1960's. To this end, we have developed a novel model of allogeneic HCT- associated RSV infection. B6 mice, normally resistent to RSV infection are dramatically more susceptible following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (Allo-HCT). We will investigate the potential benefit of pre-transplant vaccination against RSV via pursuing the following two Aims: Aim 1: Determine the immunogenicity and efficacy of live versus inactivated pre-transplant vaccination on RSV susceptibility Aim 2: Interrogate the mechanisms of post-transplant immunity to RSV Together, these studies will allow us determine whether vaccinating patients prior to hematopoietic cell/ bone marrow transplant can prevent respiratory infection in the post-transplant period.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantifying Environmental Variables Affecting Airborne Influenza Transmission In most temperate climates, influenza prevails in cold, dry winter months. However, in some temperate and tropical regions, influenza epidemicity is correlated with extremes of precipitation, not dryness, and can circulate at low levels essentiallyyear-round or appear in uni- or bi-modal annual outbreaks. How environmental variables affect influenza circulation in the human population remains poorly understood, in part because the science behind airborne respiratory virus transmission crosses disciplinary boundaries between the biomedical and physical sciences, encompassing fields as diverse as virology, physiology, epidemiology, fluid mechanics, aerosol science, and climatology. Here we seek to understand how individual environmental variables - such as temperature, humidity, and airflow - cumulatively affect the transmission probability of influenza viruses in a representative mammalian experimental system. The theoretical framework behind these studies is a novel quantitative model, based upon data gathered in experimental guinea pigs, which attempts to characterize the impact of the environment on influenza virus transmission between infected and susceptible hosts. This project bridges the gap between virology and engineering in bringing together three co- investigators with relevant and complementary skill sets: Dr. Nicole Bouvier, a physician-scientist with extensive experience in the transmission of influenza viruses among guinea pigs; Dr. William Ristenpart, an engineer with expertise in the application of high-speed imaging technologies to investigations of complex fluid dynamics; and Dr. Anthony Wexler, an authority on aerosol transport who has developed novel techniques for high-resolution imaging of aerosol deposition in the rodent respiratory tract. Our preliminary theoretical modeling has generated innovative interpretations of the experimental data, yielding three testable hypotheses, which form the basis of this proposal: (1) Influenza virus transmission probability will decrease with increased airflow speed, (2) transmission probability will decrease with the degree of turbulence, and (3) transmission probability will increase with the time integral of the viral concentration within the inoculated animal. Rigorously controlled laboratory studies, designed to isolate a single variable for analysis while others are held constant, will provide a quantitative framework for understanding the cumulative effects of temperature, humidity, airflow velocity, turbulence, and position on the transmission of human influenza viruses in a relevant animal model. Quantifying these environmental variables, individually and cumulatively, will enable their extrapolation to larger environments and time scales, with the potential to transform our understanding of the epidemiology of seasonal and pandemic influenza.',\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant Adolescent girls in South Africa remain disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic, despite the availability of several behavioural interventions to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV. Strategies to reduce HIV transmission in this key population would benefit greatly from a better understanding of the sexual networks that drive HIV transmission in adolescent girls. Furthermore, if HIV infection rates in adolescent girlscan be reduced, this could break critical chains of transmission and decrease the spread of HIV in the general population. We hypothesise that complex sexual networks, including mixing between adolescents and community members, drive high HIV incidence in adolescent girls in rural South Africa. To test our hypothesis we will utilize an innovative approach to identify networks of HIV transmission that combine extensive epidemiologic sampling with phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 sequence data and traditional sexual networking methods. Phylogenetic analysis has recently emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to use viral diversity to examine the underlying dynamics of HIV-1 transmission in affected populations. However, these methods have often failed to find linkages in endemic settings; this is likely due to underrepresentation because of sparse sampling of transmission pairs in large populations of HIV infected individuals. One of the major innovations of this proposal is identifying HIV-1 clusters and viral linkages in adolescents and link these to community sequences by extensively sampling HIV infected individuals from a defined geographic area (part of the sub-district of Vulindlela in KwaZulu-Natal), using several epidemiologic approaches to achieve a 'saturating' rate of population coverage. This area is uniquely suited for this research as the study area is rural and geographically well defined; it is one of the highest HIV burden districts in South Afric and CAPRISA has collected detailed data on the structural, behavioural and biological determinants of risks of HIV infection in this community over the last decade. Building on our expertise in HIV surveillance in this area we will i) enhance the representativeness of the phylogenetic analyses by combining novel recruitment strategies including clinic- and school-based recruitment, and respondent-driven sampling for hard-to-reach populations; ii) use high- throughput sequencing, and bioinformatics to identify HIV-1 transmission networks through HIV-1 viral linkages; and iii) include behavioural and biological information and other risk factors. This approach will allow us to characterize HIV transmission clusters and viral linkages in this hyper endemic region, analyze the contribution of HIV clusters to the new infections occurring among adolescent girls, and use this data to improve HIV prevention efforts in this key population for HIV control.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antiretroviral treatment (ART) markedly reduces the risk of HIV transmission between stable HIV discordant heterosexual partners and increasing ART use can effect  population-level  reductions in HIV incidence. Whether or not HIV prevention interventions, such as ART  Treatment as Prevention  (TasP) strategies can significantly reduce epidemic growth rates remains a matter of considerable debate, though current community-randomized TasP trials will require vast infrastructure and financial resources. Alternative, less resource-prohibitive approaches are needed, that ideally would also provide real-time insight into HIV transmission dynamics and be easily modified to address unique regional and epidemiological factors. Prospective studies of prevention and treatment interventions that target epidemiologic  hot spots  of HIV transmission may provide an opportunity to efficiently interrupt HIV transmission chains. Effective prevention interventions ar particularly relevant in populations of men who have sex with men (MSM) since their incidence rates are disproportionately high compared to other risk groups. We propose to use molecular epidemiology and computational modeling to estimate in real time the risk of onward HIV transmission in newly HIV diagnosed persons. We have shown that by evaluating HIV sequences that are generated in 'real- time' after a participant is identified from our San Diego Primary HIV infection Cohort (SD PIC), a partial transmission network can be inferred rapidly and reliably, and this network can be leveraged to better measure the efficacy of treatments and interventions, correlates of transmission risk, and estimate the size and features of the San Diego HIV epidemic. The proposed study will also address concerns related to patient confidentiality, specifically - unintended disclosure of HIV status or a putative transmission link We will develop sophisticated quantitative methods to preserve privacy prior to future consideration of potential public health applications. Our primary hypothesis is that the efficacy of HIV prevention interventions, such as TasP (i.e., ART), can be measured within a well-characterized MSM epidemic, using network statistics to assess real time changes in HIV transmission dynamics within the population. This proposal will address the following Specific Aims: 1) To infer the San Diego HIV transmission network using molecular epidemiology and use agent-based simulations to estimate features of the underlying infected population and efficacy of potential interventions, 2) To assess the potential of molecular epidemiology and network statistics to measure the efficacy of ART as a network-based prevention intervention, by comparing HIV transmission rates in persons who initiate early ART compared to those who either delay or decline ART, and 3) To develop and deploy privacy preserving methods for computing transmission network statistics. These same methods could be easily replicated in a prospective fashion across diverse HIV epidemics and could help to prioritize interventions within the scope of available resources.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections, morbidity, and mortality in infants and young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals worldwide. Despite decades of intensive research, treatment options are limited and in need of improvement. Non-structural proteins 1 (NS1) and 2 (NS2) are multifunctional proteins that play critical roles in RSV virulence and pathogenesis. NS1/2 are involved in host immune suppression, including inhibition of Type I interferon (IFN) induction and signaling, as well as inhibition of the NF-κB pathway and apoptosis. Although many host factors are thought to be targeted by RSV NS1/2 protein, currently no structures of NS1 or NS2 are available. The lack of structural studies limits our knowledge and corresponding mechanistic insights into immune evasion facilitated by these non-structural proteins. Moreover, this gap in knowledge also restricts our ability to develop countermeasures. In order to address this gap, we will (a) develop a structural and mechanistic understanding of viral immune antagonists NS1/2 proteins and (b) characterize their interactions with IFN production and response signaling pathways, including IRF3, STAT1, and STAT2 using biochemical and structural methods. Findings from these studies will be tested in vivo to identify residues critical for immune antagonist function. Through these studies, we expect to define the molecular basis for how RSV NS1/2 contributes to immune evasion and identify new targets for therapeutic and antiviral development.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The very young and the elderly are particularly susceptible to respiratory infections induced by streptococcus, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) making these populations high priority targets for effective vaccines. Much of our understanding of immunity in the elderly has been acquired through studies on mice, which do not always translate to humans. Our incomplete knowledge of the fundamental immunology of aged human populations impedes our ability to design effective vaccines t a r g e t i n g t h i s population. What would greatly enhance our current knowledge is an effective in vivo model for a g e d human immune responses that could be experimentally manipulated. A humanized mouse model has been developed in which the fully functionally mature B, T and dendritic cells found in null peripheral blood (PBL) are transferred into immunodeficient NOD.scid.IL2rgc (NSG) mice. Although immune reconstitution is immediate B cells are not maintained. Our laboratory has found providing PBL reconstituted NSG mice with the critical B cell growth and survival factor, B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), either by injection of recombinant protein or production from an AAV delivered huBLyS transgene, supports the survival and function of human B cells and allows robust responses to both T cell dependent and independent immunogens. In this submission we propose to extend our model to the study of the immune responses of elderly humans. We hypothesize that NSG mice reconstituted with PBL from elderly adults will retain the immune response characteristics of the individuals from which they where obtained. We have been able to elicit, in humanized mice prepared using the PBL from healthy young to middle aged donors, humoral immune responses to RSV and to RSV based virus-like particles (VLPs) that are isotype-switched, affinity matured and virus neutralizing and to produce a collection of human monoclonal antibodies specific for RSV-F and Ga envelope proteins.  RSV infection does not produce durable humoral immunity or B memory cells specific for RSV making development of an effective vaccine challenging. We posit age disparate immunologically humanized surrogates will allow us to model and define the cellular mechanisms that effect responses to pathogens and vaccines. Experimentally, we propose to use young and elderly humanized surrogates t o compare and contrast immune responsiveness, immunoglobulin repertoire, and the induction of protective anti-RSV antibody as induced by either RSV infection or immunization with an RSV-VLP demonstrated to induce durable protective immunity in mice. The proposed studies should facilitate attempts to develop immunization strategies effective for the young and elderly.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the second most common pathogen causing healthcare associated infection (HAI) in neonates. S. aureus strains with resistance to common antibiotics, specifically methicillin- resistant S. aureus (MRSA), account for up to 35% of S. aureus infections in neonates and have an associated mortality of up to 25%. Despite aggressive measures to prevent S. aureus infections in neonates, the burden of S. aureus disease remains high in this population. We propose a new approach to assess the effectiveness of decolonization for prevention of S. aureus transmission in the NICU. Our preliminary data suggest that MRSA transmission may be driven by untreated neonates and decolonization may reduce MRSA transmission in the NICU. We propose to use probabilistic models to assess the impact of decolonization and colonization pressure on MRSA transmission, while accounting for other relevant factors in transmission, such as healthcare worker hand hygiene compliance and MRSA strain type. Our long term goal is to identify and test interventions that will reduce MRSA transmission and infections in neonates. The specific aims are to optimize methods for measuring the independent effect of decolonization on MRSA transmission in the NICU, and to determine the impact of decolonization on MRSA transmission in neonates in a multicenter retrospective cohort study. In Sub aim 1, we will identify a cohort ofneonates admitted to the JHH NICU and assess the impact of colonization pressure and decolonization on MRSA transmission using probabilistic models. In Sub aim 2, using data obtained from two collaborating NICUs, we will test the exportability of the methods and the validity of the findings established in Sub aim 1. The findings of this proposal could inform futur prospective studies or change practice outright.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vibrio cholerae is a water-borne pathogen and causative agent of cholera. Its ability to disseminate and persist in fresh water establishes a reservoir from which outbreaks occur. However, the strong link between epidemics and overcrowding suggests a more efficient mode of fecal-oral transmission, which is supported by studies showing rapid and efficient spread of cholera within households. Knowledge of the bacterial and environmental factors that influence dissemination and transmission would contribute to a better understanding of cholera outbreaks, and to better public health measures to prevent them. We showed that V. cholerae exits humans in a physiological state(s) primed for dissemination and transmission. However, we found that the V. cholerae genes that contribute to dissemination and transmission are largely distinct, and that expression of individual genes occurs in only a fraction of the cells being shed. Thus, we hypothesize that distinct subpopulations are shed, one primed for dissemination and the other for rapid transmission. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate and characterize these different subpopulations by physically separating them for phenotypic and gene expression studies. In clinical samples, we identified a lytic phage that closely associates with epidemic V. cholerae. We discovered a dynamic arms race between this phage and V. cholerae that is occurring within humans and aquatic environment. In Aim 2, we will determine how dynamics of phage predation impact dissemination and transmission of V. cholerae. We found that vaccination with purified V. cholerae outer membrane vesicles elicits antibodies recognizing LPS O-antigen, that these antibodies are sufficient for protection, and that V. cholerae passing through an immune host are rendered avirulent. In Aim 3, we will examine the mechanism of protection and blocking of transmission. These studies will establish a basis for understanding how V. cholerae simultaneously promotes dissemination and transmission, how pervasive lytic phages impact these processes, and how vaccination blocks infection and transmission. This knowledge will enhance understanding of water- borne pathogens and help pave the way to development of interventions that target the transmissible and disseminative forms of such pathogens.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our laboratory is to better understand the age-based differences in host immunity that affect acute and chronic pulmonary disease outcomes so we can improve therapeutic and vaccine strategies for infant and elderly populations. Our current research focus is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an infection that causes severe disease in the very old and very young, has no available vaccine and no effective therapy. We have developed an infant mouse model of RSV infection to improve our understanding of infant versus adult host immune responses to RSV infection. It is known is that the accumulation of cellular debris and airway occlusion is a consequence of severe RSV disease and alveolar macrophages (AMs), which make up >90% of airway cells, are responsible for clearing cell debris. However, little is known about how immature infant AMs contribute to severe disease or their potential for immunomodulation to mitigate RSV pathology. The goal of the proposed work is to determine the extent to which infant AMs prolong RSV replication and impair removal of apoptotic cells during infection and if immune modulation with inhaled IFNγ mitigates these effects. We have shown that treatment with inhaled IFNγ increases AM activation, expedites RSV clearance, and reduces the number apoptotic cells and mucus in infant BALB/c mice. We hypothesize that infant AMs contribute to the accumulation of apoptotic cellular debris and prolong RSV replication due to an immature lung environment which can be mitigated with inhaled IFNγ. To test our hypothesis we will complete two Specific Aims. The first Aim is to determine the mechanisms by which inhaled IFNγ enhances the clearance of RSV, apoptotic cells (ACs), and mucus and protects against RSV-mediated airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in neonatal mice. Results of this aim are expected to show that mice with depleted AMs will have reduced M1 and M2c AM function which is required for clearance of ACs, delayed RSV clearance, and increased airway resistance and that IFNγ acts on AMs to resolve these effects. Specific Aim 2 will define the signals that regulate the efferocytosis of RSV-laden A549 cells by human cord and adult blood monocyte-derived macrophages with or without IFNγ priming. We expect IL-10/M-CSF polarized M2c macrophages, regardless of source, will increase AC clearance more than \\\\TGFß-polarized macrophages during RSV infection, but in the absence of T-cell recruitment, inhaled IFNγ will mitigate RSV-mediated impaired efferocytosis.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects nearly all children by 2 years of age and the leading cause of serious lower respiratory tract disease in young children worldwide. RSV then causes repeat infections that can be serous and life threatening throughout life. It is estimated that RSV leads to 160,000 deaths each year globally and up to 150,000 hospitalizations in the United States in children <5 years of age. The burden of RSV disease has led RSV vaccines are being developed for the young RSV naïve child and RSV primed older children and adults. The first RSV vaccine, formalin-inactivated RSV with alum adjuvant (FI-RSV), led to more severe disease with later natural infection. The experience of FI-RSV enhanced disease has generated concern for any non-live virus vaccine in RSV naïve children. Therefore, the field has developed live- attenuated vaccines for young children whereas multiple approaches, including inactivated and subunit vaccines, are pursued for RSV primed older children and adults. Despite over 50 years of research, however, no vaccine is available. The failure to develop an effective vaccine suggests that novel approaches and improvements to existing vaccines are needed. The goal of this proposal is to develop G proteins that can be incorporated into existing or new vaccines to improve their safety and efficacy. The rationale for this proposal follows from the fact that 1) natural infection and administration of high titer of RSV neutralizing antibodies provides only partial protection from disease, 2) the G protein induces host responses that contribute to disease, and 3) binding G with antibodies can prevent much of the G-associated disease. The G protein is one of two RSV proteins shown to induce protective immune responses and most vaccines have focused on induced neutralizing antibodies with the F protein. Since antibodies against the central conserved region of G (CCR-G) decrease disease in animals without decreasing virus replication, we hypothesize that G protein constructs specifically designed to increase the level of anti-CCR-G antibodies will eliminate disease enhancing responses and make a vaccine safer and more effective. Since CCR-G is also the most conserved region, it is the region in G best suited to elicit immunity that protects across different RSV strains. The CCR-G does contain amino acid sequences associated with disease but these sequences will be mutated to ensure safety. We propose to make and test a variety of G protein constructs and identify 1 or 2 that induce high titer of anti-CCR-G antibodies, decrease disease with later infection, and can be used in subunit and/or live virus vaccine platforms through two aims: Aim 1: Identify G protein constructs that induce high titers of anti-CCR-G antibodies and decrease disease in RSV-challenged mice after vaccination. Aim 2: Test the vaccine potential of G-modified live RSVs in a mouse model.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of infant hospitalization, and severe RSV bronchiolitis has been identified as a risk factor for th subsequent development of asthma in children. There is no currently available therapy for RSV bronchiolitis. Moreover, no vaccine is FDA-approved and the only prevention option for RSV infection is palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the RSV fusion protein. Given the frequency and severity of infection, the development of new treatment options is imperative. Our preliminary data suggest that exogenous prostaglandin (PG) I2 is a novel therapeutic target for RSV. Our group reported that mice that constitutively overexpress PGI synthase (PGIS) were significantly protected from RSV-induced illness. In addition, we found that mice which cannot signal through the PGI2 receptor (IP) had significantly exacerbated weight loss and delayed recovery after RSV infection. In a collaborative study of infants admitted with RSV bronchiolitis, we found that a functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the PGI synthase (PGIS) gene was associated with an increase in the urinary PGI2 metabolite and less severe RSV bronchiolitis. These data strongly support that endogenous PGI2 protects against RSV-induced illness. To pave the way for a clinical effectiveness study using PGI2 for the treatment of RSV infection, we must perform preclinical studies to determine how exogenous PGI2 regulates RSV-induced illness and determine the mechanisms by which exogenous PGI2 modulates host antiviral immunity. Interleukin 13 (IL-13) can be produced by T helper 2 (Th2) cells and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). During RSV infection, IL-13 mediates mucus production, which directly contributes to airway obstruction and respiratory failure. On the other hand, IL-10, which can be produced by T regulatory cells (Tregs), inhibits RSV-induced inflammation. RSV-specific CD8+ T cells are a major source of IFN- , which limits viral replication. I found significantly decreased lung IL-13 accompanied by increased lung IL-10 and IFN- in RSV-infected mice treated with exogenous PGI2. Accordingly, I hypothesize that exogenous PGI2 attenuates IL-13 producing- Th2 cells and ILC2s while enhancing IFN- -producing CD8+ T cells and IL-10-producing Tregs during RSV infection, resulting in decreased RSV-induced illness. In Aim 1, I hypothesize that exogenous PGI2 inhibits RSV-induced Th2 cell and ILC2 cytokine expression and proliferation, while enhancing Treg cytokine expression and proliferation, resulting in attenuated mucus production. In Aim 2, I hypothesize that exogenous PGI2 enhances RSV-specific CD8+ T cell activation and proliferation, resulting in decreased viral replication during RSV infection. These studies will advance the field in that theywill determine how PGI2, an FDA-approved agent, attenuates RSV illness. The current availability of PGI2 for human treatment highlights the clinical significance of my studies as thistherapy could be immediately transferrable to RSV disease.',\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children, however no vaccine is currently available. The overall objective of this grant is to develop optimal live attenuated RSV vaccine candidate(s). The significance of this P01 is that it brings together a multidisciplinary group of investigators to leverage a novel observation that infants with severe RSV disease display a pattern of inadequate (or suppressed) immune responses. The grant will simultaneously attack this problem on multiple fronts by developing a vaccine with increased immunogenicity, attenuating the virus in a novel, `tunable' way, improving its yield in cell culture to improve vaccine production, and using gene expression and new antibody detection tools for analysis of the immune response in order to predict vaccine effectiveness and safety. These candidates will be tested first in vitro in primary well differentiated human airway epithelial cultures. Vaccine candidates with the desired characteristics will be selected for testing in vivo in cotton rats fortheir attenuation and their ability to induce a `safe' host response (similar to natural mild RSV disease in infants), and potent neutralizing antibodies to RSV. Combination mutants will be recycled through this system, resulting in the selection of one optimal vaccine candidate and rank order of excellent backups. By integrating the host response to RSV infection with modifications of the virus that improve these responses, the four projects of this P01 will synergize to develop an optimized live attenuated RSV vaccine candidate ready for testing in human primates and possibly clinical trials.\",\n",
       " \"AbstractOne of the stumbling blocks to development of a live-attenuated RSV vaccine is induction of long-lastingimmunity, which does not occur even with wild-type RSV infection. Since induction of robust adaptive immunityresponses requires a strong innate immune activation, the short-lived anti-RSV response may be due to viralinhibition of type I interferon (IFN) induction. Antagonism of IFN production is largely due to the RSV NS1protein, which is not absolutely essential for virus replication in culture although deletion of NS1 results indecreased viral replication even in IFN-deficient cells such as Vero. This proposal will identify domains and/orspecific residues of NS1 responsible for IFN antagonism by targeted mutagenesis. Mutants that ablate the IFNantagonist function without affecting protein stability will be inserted into recombinant RSV (rRSV) and testedfor their capacity to replicate in Vero cells and induce IFN in A549 cells. NS1 mutant rRSV that induce highlevels of IFN expression and replicate well in these cell lines will be tested for IFN antagonism and replicationin human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures. Further, the NS1 mutant rRSV will be tested in cotton rats, whichare the best small animal model for RSV infection to determine replication in vivo, pathogenicity,immunogenicity, and protection from WT challenge. The best candidate NS1 mutants will be combined with the`repaired' G gene (Project 2) and the best attenuating L methyltransferase (MTase) mutations (Project 3) toproduce double and triple mutant viruses that replicate well in Vero cells, induce high levels of IFN, efficientlyinfect HAE culture, and are attenuated and protective in cotton rats. Although beyond the scope of this P01,these vaccine candidates will be tested in non-human primate trials in the future.\",\n",
       " 'Project 3: Attenuating RSV with Mutations in Its MethyltransferasePI: Jianrong Li, DVM, PhDAbstract:Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading causative agent of pediatric respiratory tract diseaseworldwide. Despite major efforts, there is no vaccine currently available to combat this virus. Live attenuatedvaccines are the most promising vaccine candidates for RSV. However, it has been a challenge to identifyan attenuated RSV strain that has an optimal balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. Theobjectives of this project are to rationally attenuate RSV by targeting the viral mRNA cap methyltransferase(MTase) and to develop MTase-defective viruses as novel live attenuated vaccine candidates for RSV. TheRSV mRNA cap structure is methylated at the guanine-N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2’-O positions by a singleconserved region VI (CR-VI) located in the large (L) polymerase protein. Amino acid residues essential forG-N-7 and/or 2’-O MTase activities will be characterized and will be introduced into an infectious cDNAclone of RSV. Recombinant RSVs defective in G-N-7 and/or 2’-O MTase activities will be recovered, andtheir attenuation in cell culture will be characterized. These recombinant viruses will be tested for theirinfectivity and ability to spread in primary, well differentiated, human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures. Next,their replication, pathogenesis, immunogenicity, and capacity to induce protection will be examined in cottonrats, the best available small animal model for RSV. By adding interferon-producing NS1 mutations (Project1) and ‘repaired G’ mutations (Project 2) to the most promising MTase mutations in L to RSV, we expectthat we will generate a panel of ideal RSV vaccine strains that grow well in Vero cells, are attenuated in vitroand in vivo, genetically stable, and highly immunogenic. These new, improved live RSV vaccine candidatescan then be used for future trials in nonhuman primates.',\n",
       " \"Abstract A reduction in disease severity is the most likely indicator that an RSV vaccine is effective in young infants, the highest priority target population. However, we don't have precise markers to objectively assess RSV disease severity, which has made the evaluation of RSV vaccines in infants challenging. By applying a systems immunology approach our goal is to define the immune profiles, serum antibody responses, and RSV NS variants in infants with mild RSV infection, who represent the ideal model of a desirable vaccine induced outcomes. Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that robust interferon (IFN) and innate immune responses, related in part to viral NS1 and/or NS2 variants, result in optimal B-cell activation, antibody responses (measured in Core C), and improved clinical outcomes in RSV infected infants. Identification of the “safe and protective” profile to natural RSV infection will inform the selection of vaccine candidates (develop in Projects 1,2,3) in cotton rats (Core B) that should induce similar (or improved) profiles. In addition, these prototype profiles will serve as surrogate markers for the “safe and protective” response in future vaccine trials testing the live attenuated RSV vaccine developed in this P01. We will test our hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Define the blood transcriptional signatures that correlate with mild RSV infection; 2) Define quantity and neutralizing activity of specific RSV antibodies associated with acute and long-term protection from severe RSV infection; 3) Identify the RSV NS1 and NS2 gene haplotypes that best correlate with disease severity.\",\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our overall goal is to discover small molecule chaperones targeting \\uf061-synuclein (\\uf061Syn) that prevent the prion-like transmission of misfolded \\uf061Syn and can be developed into drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's (PD), Diffuse Lewy Body, and Alzheimer's diseases. These drugs will act via a novel mechanism of action by directly interacting with \\uf061Syn to prevent spreading of \\uf061Syn in thebrain, with the ultimate goal of reducing disease progression. We envision an innovative strategy by which small molecules bind to and stabilize native or other non-pathogenic states of \\uf061Syn and thereby block pathological events. Most small molecules affecting \\uf061Syn aggregation were found in aggregation assays and interact with aggregation pathway forms of \\uf061Syn. By contrast, we will test compounds that bind to \\uf061Syn native states and affect \\uf061Syn dysfunction more broadly. From a biophysical screen we previously identified 61 compounds that bind to native \\uf061Syn (\\uf061Syn-PCs) some of which prevented \\uf061Syn-mediated dysfunctions such as \\uf061Syn aggregation and \\uf061Syn-induced vesicular dysfunction. Based on these promising results, we propose to expand the development of \\uf061Syn-PCs as novel \\uf061Syn chaperone drugs. In this application, we will determine if \\uf061Syn-PCs are a viable strategy to limit \\uf061Syn cell-to-cell transmission and explore the mechanism of action of such active compounds.  We will first identify \\uf061Syn-PCs capable of preventing the cell-to-cell transmission of \\uf061Syn and in so doing, identify molecules having potential to be developed into therapeutic drugs. In Aim 1 we will screen the \\uf061Syn-PCs in cellular assays of \\uf061Syn transmission including a FRET-based assay in which transmission is measured as a direct association of donor \\uf061Syn with acceptor \\uf061Syn expressed in different cells. Based on preliminary data we expect to find active compounds. Structure activity relationships will be explored by testing activity of commercially available analogues of active compounds. In Aim 2 we will further identify which steps of transmission are modulated by different \\uf061Syn-PCs. Different compounds will likely affect \\uf061Syn transmission by different mechanisms (e.g., altered cellular levels, location, expulsion, uptake, misfolding) and thus novel mechanisms are likely to be identified using \\uf061Syn-PCs. It will be greatly informative for further therapeutic optimization to explore these novel mechanisms. We will analyze the active \\uf061Syn-PCs to identify which stage in transmission is blocked. Biochemical, microscopic and cell biological techniques will be applied to explore the cellular and extracellular location and state of \\uf061Syn in media and donor and recipient cells. These analyses will elucidate how active \\uf061Syn-PCs modulate the transmission of \\uf061Syn and will shed light on possible assays that would be useful for future development of these molecules into drugs to treat patients.  These studies will provide the first evidence for efficacy of \\uf061Syn chaperones in blocking the transmission of a critical protein involved in PD progression and pathology and will provide the foundation for the development of a novel class of drugs for treating \\uf061Syn related neurodegenerative diseases.\",\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection accounts for substantial worldwide morbidity and some mortality among infants and elderly and those with cardiac or pulmonary issues. The standard of care for RSV-infected patients is limited to supportive therapy, and there is no safe and efficacious RSV vaccine. There is one approved anti-RSV drug, i.e. inhaled ribavirin, but its effectiveness is questionable and it is difficult toadminister. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a novel class of RSV anti-viral therapeutics that target the host protein nuclear export machinery (Exportin-1/XPO1) that is co-opted by RSV for its replication. A prototypical inhibitor of XPO1, leptomycin B (LMB) has been shown in vitro to block RSV replication. However, LMB failed Phase 1 trials due to in vivo toxicity with anorexia and malaise. Karyopharm Therapeutics has developed first-in-class selective inhibitors of nuclear export which block XPO1-directed nuclear export. One compound, KPT-335 (Verdinexor), is in a late-phase development for treatment of canine malignancy. We hypothesize that KPT-335 will safely and effectively block RSV replication by inhibiting nuclear export of RSV M protein. As the nuclear export signal (NES) of the RSV M protein is conserved among strains, we propose therapeutic and prophylactic studies to assess KPT-335 efficacy against different RSV group A and B strains, and determine the mechanism of action against RSV by evaluating M protein localization and XPO1 binding to the M protein. The overall goal of these studies proposed is to achieve a critical milestone and establish in vitro anti-RSV efficacy of KPT-335 as the basis to move this important drug forward for prospective in vivo studies.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent discoveries about small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have significantly advanced human genetics and molecular biology, largely due to the identification of a fundamental role of microRNAs (miRNAs), the best- characterized sncRNA family, as gene regulators. tRNA-derived RNA Fragments (tRFs) are a recently discovered sncRNA family that is ubiquitously expressed in organisms ranging from prokaryotes to humans, yet their biological functions and the mechanism(s) underlying those functions are largely unknown. Studies by our group have shown that the sncRNAs most highly induced by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) belong to the tRF family, while the change in miRNA expression is minimal. These induced tRFs are functional and involved in the regulation of RSV replication. Notably, at least three tested tRFs have a gene trans- silencing function that is mechanistically distinct from that of miRNAs. However, more experimental evidence is needed to determine whether there is a widespread impact of mammalian tRFs on the regulation of gene expression, and more importantly, what mechanism(s) tRFs use for their gene regulatory function. In this project we propose the novel hypothesis that functional tRFs induced by RSV have a common gene trans-silencing function. Since RSV-induced tRFs are localized in the cytoplasm (and so are unlikely to play a role in regulating gene transcription, usually a nuclear event), we also hypothesize that the gene-suppression effect of tRFs occurs at post-transcriptional steps, e.g., mRNA stability or translation. In this exploratory project, these hypotheses will be tested in two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, tRFs important for RSV replication, viral gene expression and associated chemokine/cytokine induction will be identified. We will then determine whether these functional tRFs have gene trans-silencing activity. Aim 2 will test our second hypothesis that the gene- suppression effect of tRFs occurs at post-transcriptional steps. High-throughput methods, including microarray or proteomics analyses, will then be used to identify target candidates for a representative tRF. Target candidates will be experimentally confirmed by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. A mutagenesis study will also be performed to confirm that the effect of the tRF on its target(s) is direct and specific. This project may hav important translational implications by suggesting new therapeutic opportunities to modulate viral replication, providing experimental evidence to build a database of functional tRFs, and of more importance to identify the consensus features of tRF*target interaction for the development of a tRF target- prediction algorithm, which will undoubtedly facilitate the discovery of new gene regulatory networks and so will broadly benefit the research community. These goals will be explored in a future R01 application based on the results of this exploratory project.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the major cause of bronchiolitis in infants. Human infant bronchioles infected by RSV are commonly noted to be occluded by sloughed, RSV-infected epithelial cells which along with neutrophil-dominant inflammatory cell infiltrates contribute to acute obstruction of the distal airways. Our long term goals are to understand why RSV has such a propensity for causing bronchiolitis in human infants and to identify therapeutic approaches for reducing the severity of RSV distal airway disease. We have recently identified the RSV Non-Structural protein 2 (NS2) as being responsible for the shedding of RSV-infected columnar epithelial cells providing direct evidence that epithelial cell shedding may be a specific consequence of RSV infection. Using hamsters as an in vivo model of airway infection we have demonstrated RSV NS2-promoted cell shedding into the distal bronchiolar airway lumen results in robust accumulation of shed and virus-infected epithelial cells which clog and obstruct the infected distal airways. As these pathological consequences of RSV NS2 expression in hamster distal airways are strikingly similar to the histopathology obtained from human infants with RSV bronchiolitis we propose RSV NS2 is an important viral genetic determinant for distal airway cytopathology and disease during RSV infection. In this Pilot and Feasibility study, we focus on the development of better models for further understanding the consequences of RSV NS2 expression to enable testing of novel therapies to modulate the cell shedding response. We also attempt to identify novel biomarkers of RSV NS2 expression in the distal airways useful for determining efficacy of novel therapeutic approaches in the lab and in the clinic. Strategies to modify the cell shedding response to RSV NS2 may provide novel therapeutic approaches for reducing the incidence and severity of RSV bronchiolitis. We perform three independent but inter-related Aims: Specific Aim 1: Are the consequences of RSV NS2 expression more prolonged and severe in the distal airways of infant hamsters? Specific Aim 2. Generation of Precision Cut Lung Slices to investigate the impact of RSV NS2 expression in the bronchiolar airway epithelium ex vivo. Specific Aim 3. Does RSV NS2 modification of epithelial keratins provide novel biomarkers for distal airway infection? By performing these Aims we expect to generate better models for understanding the impact of RSV NS2 expression on distal airway pathology and identify novel biomarkers for assessing distal airway epithelium involvement during RSV infection. Successful completion of these Aims will serve as the foundation of future studies to identify strategies to reduce the impact of the consequences of RSV NS2 expression.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterosexual HIV-1 transmission to women accounts for the majority of new infections worldwide, and effective prevention modalities will likely have to interdict virus or virally-infected cells prior to HIV-1 dissemination to secondary lymphoid compartments. However, the biological and molecular basis of early virus-host interactions that lead to the establishment of HIV-1 infection in the female genital tract mucosa remains poorly understood. Studies of transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses revealed a phenotype of weak macrophage tropism, and in primate model studies resting memory CD4+ T cells were the principal early target of SIV infection. One interpretation of these findings is that HIV-1 macrophage (Mf) tropism is not an important property for mucosal HIV-1 transmission, but emerges later in HIV-1 pathogenesis. Consequently, the potential role of tissue mucosal macrophages (mMfs) in male-to-female HIV-1 transmission has largely been discounted. In a recent report we now show that, through a previously unrecognized pathway, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) can be efficiently infected with R5 (T/F) but not X4 viruses as they specifically recognize and phagocytose infected CD4+ T lymphocytes (Baxter et al., 2014). If this mechanism was operative in vivo, it would have important implications for understanding HIV-1 transmission. Infected Mf can harbor, produce and release infectious HIV-1 without succumbing to cytopathic effects, and, thus, if resident mMf infection occurred (via such pathway) within the first few days, it could drive the expansion of virus beyond localized foci that, in NHP models, have been observed in the vaginal mucosa just days after exposure to SIV. We submit that our findings provide a compelling, potentially paradigm-shifting argument for interrogating the potential role of cervicovaginal mMfs in virus-host interactions in early infection and virus amplification in the female genital tract mucosa, and possibly gain new insights into selective R5 virus transmission. To test our HYPOTHESIS that T/F (R5) virus infection spreads from infected CD4+ T lymphocytes to cervical tissue Mfs, and early productive infection of Mf in the cervical mucosa augments virus replication and spread to surrounding mucosal cell targets, we will utilize complementary human cervical cell models of HIV-1 transmission and innovative virologic tools. We will investigate two SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Elucidate the susceptibility of cervical Mf and CD4+ T cells, isolated from mucosal tissues, to T/F and X4  strains of HIV-1 by cell-free and cell-cell-mediated pathways of virus infection; and 2. Elucidate the susceptibility of Mf in situ, in cervical tissue explants, to T/F strains of HIV-1by cell-free and  cell-cell-mediated infection pathways, and their contribution to virus amplificationand spread within tissue. This project is of potential high impact, as it addresses fundamental questions of HIV-1 transmission, and complements existing models of rectal and cervicovaginal SIV transmission. Our work will contribute new insights into HIV/SIV transmission highly relevant to the development of efficacious prevention strategies.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host behavior and pathogen-specific life history generate complex patterns of pathogen exposure that drive transmission heterogeneity. Our overreaching hypothesis is that variation in pathogen exposure leads to important heterogeneities in infection traits and transmission that can be exploited for control purposes. The project will integrate data generated in a natural infection model system (Escherichia coli - cattle) through experimental challenge studies, field transmission studies, and animal movement monitoring systems with mathematical models. The specific aims are to (1) Characterize sources of heterogeneity for enteric disease transmission in cattle production systems: Data will be collected on the variation in pathogen dynamics in the host-associated environments, the contact structure among hosts, between host and specific environments, and the dose dependency of infection traits. (2) Develop a modeling framework to integrate and investigate the sources of heterogeneity for enteric pathogens for disease transmission. Individual-based and meal-field models will be developed to investigate the effect of the contact structure and variation of the exposure on population transmission patterns. Models will be parameterized and validated using data collected in longitudinal field studies. (3) Assessment of the implications ofexposure heterogeneity in enteric disease control. The developed models will be used to investigate and identify intervention strategies that could lead to reduction in transmission. The proposed research will advance the understanding of the transmission of enteric pathogens by developing and analyzing models that are well-grounded in the processes associated with transmission and tightly connected to collected unique high-resolution, longitudinal data on host-host and host-environment contacts, extra-host dynamics of pathogens, and pathogen transfer. Overall this project will generate a broader understanding of the interaction between sources of heterogeneity on disease transmission and how to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity in different mathematical and computational models that is relevant to investigate ecological factors influencing disease transmission and generalizable to other host-pathogen systems.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Vector Behavior in Transmission Ecology Research Coordination Network (VectorBiTE RCN) will facilitate investigation into the role of vector behavior and life history in disease transmission dynamics. The proposed work aims to accomplish this by promoting (1) the development of theoretical models that include more details of vector behavior and heterogeneity; (2) improved data collection and statistical methods to enable such models to be confronted with data; (3) development of comprehensive and freely available validation datasets to allow testing of methods and comparison between proposed models in a transparent fashion; and (4) training of young researchers in these new tools and methods as they are developed. These objectives will be accomplished through: (A) annual meetings and workshops to bring together empirical and theoretical biologists across diverse systems and institutions; (B) the development of an online platform with repositories for data on vector behavior and code for modeling the role of behavior on transmission dynamics; and (C) providing opportunities to educate fellow researchers and the public about network advances via online and conference presentations. Intellectual Merit: Complex vector behaviors and life history traits are often expressed as fixed values in models and do not vary over vector lifespan, with vector infection status or condition, or in response to environmental variation. There is mounting empirical evidence that vector behavioral ecology does vary across all of these scales. However, tools to incorporate this variability to understand transmission dynamics are lacking. This gap presents key questions such as: Do altered behaviors in infected vectors alter disease dynamics? What conditions promote transmission and how will globalization and climate change alter the distribution and intensity of vector borne diseases? Which control strategies might minimize the evolution of transmission/resistance? Understanding the dynamics of these diseases across medical, wildlife, veterinary, and agricultural settings, requires determining whether this variation is important for explaining dynamics. This RCN will facilitate collaborations to develop new approaches linking vector ecology with transmission.',\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, while preventable by routine vaccination, has already led to chronic HBV infection (CHB) in about 240 million people worldwide. Although antiviral drugs are available, these must be taken daily for life and are unaffordable for most of world's CHB population. Consequently, a therapeutic vaccine is needed that would stimulate sufficient immunity to control CHB. Because CD8+ T cells are both necessary and sufficient for clearing HBV from the liver, a therapeutic vaccine must elicit extremely strong anti-HBV CD8+ T cell responses. Such a vaccine must be strong enough to counter the PD-1/PD-L1 and CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress effective anti-HBV CD8+ T cells in CHB. Mouse studies have shown that stimulation the CD40 receptor on dendritic cells can generate anti-HBV CD8+ T cells that are strong enough to overcome these suppressive mechanisms and lead to long- term HBV control. Consequently, this project aims to use a powerful form of soluble multi-trimer CD40 ligand (CD40L) in conjunction with the HBV Core antigen (HBcAg). The result is a fusion protein comprised of the multimerization scaffold (SPD) with Core antigen and CD40L (SPD- Core-CD40L). This is referred to as a Multi-Trimer Antigen Adjuvant Vaccine or  MagaVax.  The Aims are to make the construct in an adenoviral vector, test its effectiveness at eliciting anti- HBV CD8+ T cells in mice in vivo, and show that i can activate human dendritic cells to present Core antigen to HBV-specific human CD8+ T cells in vitro. When these studies are complete, a MagaVax/HBV vaccine will be ready for further testing and development as treatment for CHB.\",\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory viruses are the most common cause of death in infants and children worldwide. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a negative, single-stranded RNA virus in the paramyxoviridae family, is the most frequent cause of hospitalization due to viral respiratory tract disease. The global RSV disease burden is estimated at 64 million cases and 160,000 deaths per year. The spectrum of clinical illness ranges from mild upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Treatments are limited; prophylactic administration of antibodies against RSV is expensive and impractical in most countries, and the efficacy of anti-viral drug therapy (ribavirin) is controversial due to its highcost and inability to prevent disease. No vaccine is currently available, which is a significant an serious gap in preventive medicine. Intensive new efforts toward vaccine development, such as the one proposed in this application, are clearly needed to close this gap. We have recently generated and tested both in vitro and in vivo the recombinant adenoviral vaccine encoding RSV fusion protein (Ad5.RSV-F). Significantly, one possible reason for the limited efficacy of a recombinant DNA RSV vaccine based on F antigen is poor in vivo expression caused by the presence of premature polyadenylation sites within the F protein open reading frame. We were able to genetically engineer the RSV F protein, which resulted in a robust expression of the F protein, desirable for vaccine application. In vivo efficacy studies of Ad5.RSV-F vaccine were performed on cotton rats. These studies demonstrated the ability of Ad5.RSV-F vaccine to induce a neutralizing immunity five to seven log superior to the vaccination with live RSV virus (golden standard) which result in complete protection and no viral shedding detected in the nose and the lung after RSV challenge. In order to advance this promising RSV vaccine candidate to a phase I clinical study, here we propose a three year centralized and integrated clinical vaccine manufacturing endeavor.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this proposal is to translate basic, epidemiologic, and technologic discoveries into new strategies to prevent healthcare-associated transmission of Ebola and other high-consequence pathogens. Healthcare-associated transmission of high-consequence pathogens such as the Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, novel respiratory pathogens, multidrug resistant bacteria, and Clostridium difficile poses a significant risk to patients, families, and healthcare workers (HCWs), leading tomorbidity and mortality and dramatically increased healthcare costs. Recent experience with Ebola has shown that current infection prevention strategies may be inadequate to prevent transmission of high-consequence pathogens in healthcare settings. Using our broad experience and expertise and our history of successful collaboration, we propose a multifaceted and innovative framework integrating infection prevention, human factors engineering, and mathematical modeling approaches to address knowledge gaps in current infection prevention methods and to develop new interventions to prevent the transmission of high-consequence pathogens in healthcare settings. We hypothesize that: 1) self-contamination of HCW while doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) can be prevented by elucidating risk factors for HCW self-contamination and designing effective risk mitigation strategies to prevent HCW self-contamination events, 2) pathogen transmission from environmental sources can be effectively prevented by elucidating specific risk factors in environmental service (EVS) worker training, communication, culture and processes and designing effective interventions to optimize environmental cleaning and disinfection, 3) mathematical modeling will improve understanding of how resistance mechanisms impact transmission routes of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaciae (CRE) in healthcare settings and the effectiveness of contact precautions for the prevention of CRE transmission. We will apply human factors and mathematical modeling (T0) approaches to gather data on risk factors and potential failure modes that contribute to pathogen transmission during HCW PPE doffing, EVS cleaning and disinfection of the environment, and the care of patients who are colonized or infected with CRE. We will then use the identified risk factors and epidemiologic transmission data to develop (T1), implement (T2) and assess new strategies within a large tertiary care hospital and across a health system of hospitals (T3). In addition to our expertise in infection prevention surveillance, intervention trils, and antimicrobial stewardship, in this proposal we demonstrate our capacity to integrate distinct scientific disciplines and introduce novel applications of evidence-based risk mitigation strategies to expand the science of infection prevention. The findings from this proposal will inform CDC guidance for frontline HCWs by providing concise and practical, evidence-based recommendations to prevent pathogen transmission in order to reduce harm to patients and healthcare workers.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) increase patient morbidity and mortality. The transmission of bacteria and viruses is an area that needs further study. Our group has over 160 publications in the area of healthcare-associated infections, with over 40 publications in the application focus of transmission of infectious pathogens and identification of novel strategies to improve the effectiveness of personal protective equipment. We have translated numerous T0 results into T2 studies to prevent transmission of infectious pathogens. We have experience developing and implementing multi-site studies across the spectrum of healthcare. We have had over 16 grants funded by CDC, NIH, VA and AHRQ to study optimal methods to prevent the transmission of bacterial pathogens. We have successfully performed nine multi-center studies across over 50 institutions in 32 states. We also had a project with the Maryland state health department that we led involving 40 facilities including 30 acute care facilities and 10 long-term care facilities.Thus, we believe we are well-qualified to be chosen to be a member of the CDC Prevention Epicenters for the Prevention of Healthcare Associated Infections. Our aims directly address the funding announcement; they are: Aim 1: Perform a multi-site intensive-care unit (ICU) cohort study to determine which patient risk factors, including comorbid conditions and severity of illness markers, and which healthcare worker-patient interactions lead to greater transmission of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Aim 2: Using an existing cohort of residents from community-based nursing homes in two states, estimate the overall transmission risk for resistant Gram-negative bacteria, as well as which patient risk factors and healthcare activities lead to greater transmission. Aim 3: Perform a randomized non-inferiority trial to determine if using an alcohol-based hand rub to  clean  gloved hands when an indication for hand hygiene arises during a single patient encounter is as effective as the current recommendation of changing gloves. Aim 4: Evaluate the effectiveness of practices to decontaminate personal protective equipment (PPE) after use for antibiotic-resistant bacteria and viruses similar to Ebola and Influenza in a laboratory settin.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to establish a CDC Prevention Epicenter called,  Strategies to Prevent Infection and Reduce Inter-individual Transmission  (SPIRIT). Our overall objective is to improve control of transmission of pathogenic microorganisms through advancement of science and practice by improving knowledge about mechanisms of transmission and implementing novel strategies to prevent dissemination of pathogens within healthcare settings. We will direct a broad research portfolio that addresses key challenges in infection prevention across individual, population, and organizational levels. The resources that we bring to the CDC Prevention Epicenter Program will be broadly beneficial to its mission to improve healthcare quality and patient safety. Our work is strongly tied to operational partners and collaborators within the VA, as well as the academic medical centers with which we are affiliated. These connections provide ample access to health systems that will serve as clinical laboratories. We have accumulated the capacity and experience to implement interventions to prevent infection and combat antibiotic resistance across the continuum of care. Moreover, we have developed a computational environment to support comprehensive epidemiological analysis of infections within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health System. Our research will focus on measurement and modelling of transmission, adherence to personal protective equipment, and regional coordination of control strategies. Knowledge about how patient factors, healthcare practices, and intervention strategies influence transmission is accumulating too slowly to enable nimble responses to emerging threats. Applying new methods of infection modeling to the remarkable electronic data resources that exist within the VA to examine transmission rates of multidrug resistant organisms, we will systematically evaluate these factors and propose efficient, new experiments. Transmission of emerging pathogens such as Ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome to healthcare workers exposed problems in how health care workers don and doff personal protective equipment (PPE). We will apply methods drawn from adherence engineering to redesign equipment kits to enhance the effective use of PPE across a range of tasks. Regional strategies for infection control have the potential to prevent the spread of emergent pathogens, but face substantial barriers to effective coordinated action. We will address these challenges through implementation of approaches to enhance trust among stakeholders, increase information flow, and support alignment with local and state departments.',\n",
       " 'Choosing the least-operating cost combination of electric power generation to meet demand is at the heart of utility and Independent System Operator (ISO) functions in the running of an electric power system.  Additionally, utilities and ISOs must ensure that transmission lines will be operated within limits both under normal conditions and in the event of an outage, or failure, of a line.  These transmission limitations can limit the choices available for dispatch of generators.  A generation and transmission system operated within these limits is said to be secure. Maintaining security while seeking to minimize the operating costs of generation is a central function of utility and ISO operations and involves pro-active consideration of the many possible outages that might occur.  If an outage does actually occur, then the dispatch must subsequently be changed so that the system can withstand the next outage.  Generally, however, these actions needed to restore security are not explicitly modeled in the procedures of utilities and ISOs.  The implication is that current systems might be operated in a manner that under-utilizes transmission capacity there resulting in more expensive dispatch than necessary or operated in a manner that could threaten reliability in the event of a single failure.  This work seeks systematic methods to better represent the limitations on transmission and better represent the post-contingency restoration to security so as to improve electric generator dispatch. The graduate students will be trained in electric power engineering, optimization theory, and control systems. Students will be provided opportunities to interact with the Texas Legislative and Public utility commission, and the STEM outreach activities will extend to the South Harlem middle and high schools that serve underrepresented minorities.  This proposal aims at improving representation of post-contingency states in Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) and Independent System Operator (ISO) dispatch optimization to better ensure that transmission capability is neither under-utilized nor operated at levels that jeopardize reliability. Improved utilization of transmission capacity will contribute to lowering the overall cost of electricity supply by enabling more of the lower cost resources to be dispatched, and contribute to enhancing the integration of renewable resources by reducing transmission-related wind curtailment. Conversely, in cases where transmission may be operated in an optimistic manner, improved representation of post-contingency states will improve reliability. These improvements will be achieved by more comprehensive dispatch methodologies, that explicitly model post-contingency corrective actions, rather than through costly transmission upgrades.  The capability of the transmission system to support flows of power is typically limited by both continuous and short-term thermal limits due to the interaction of resistive heating of lines and line temperature ratings. The limits vary from line to line and also depend to some extent on ambient conditions. These limits are incorporated into RTO/ISO dispatch models. Standard formulations of RTO/ISO dispatch use security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) that represent contingencies by approximating the post-contingency flows on lines and other elements given a pre-contingency dispatch. Typically, the limits allowed for post-contingency flows reflect short-term transmission limits and are higher than the continuous ratings, with the implicit assumption that the flows can be reduced to being within continuous ratings through (unmodeled) post-contingency corrective actions before the temperature rise on the lines exceeds acceptable limits.  The approach is to utilize recent advances in fine-grain distributed optimal power flow to explicitly represent the trajectory of post-contingency flows into the optimal power flow formulation, so that the implied limit on pre-contingency flows will neither be conservative or optimistic. This will enable better utilization of existing transmission capacity.  Systematic methods to reduce the number of contingency constraints that must be explicitly represented in the optimization will also be investigated.',\n",
       " \"Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at her home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.  The award to Norfolk State University has potential broader impact in a number of areas. The project will focus on constructing a mathematical model to investigate the role of social behavior in the transmission dynamics of HIV epidemics.  The outcomes of this work can inform public health officials when analyzing and determining the impact of social behavior in the transmission of HIV epidemics. This project will also enhance the research experience and training of undergraduate students at Norfolk State University.  This project will focus on developing mathematical models, in the form of deterministic systems of nonlinear differential equations, to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the role of risky behavior on the transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS in a population.  Studies have established a strong correlation between risky behavior and the acquisition of HIV infection.  Some of these behaviors are associated with substance abuse. Although it is understood that there are different degrees or stages of substance abuse, the impact of such heterogeneity on the overall disease transmission process has not been rigorously studied.  This project will investigate these dynamics and their role in the transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS in a population.  To achieve this objective, new realistic mathematical models, which incorporate the essential features of HIV disease as well as the dynamics of relevant risky behaviors, will be developed.  These models, which will be rigorously analyzed using techniques from nonlinear dynamical systems, such as asymptotic stability and bifurcation theory, to gain insights into their dynamical features, will be parametrized using available relevant public health and demographic data. Detailed uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, using suitable sampling techniques such as Latin Hypercube Sampling and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients, will be carried out on the parameters of the models to assess the impact of uncertainty in the estimates of the parameter values used in the simulations on the overall simulation results obtained, and determine the most important parameters that drive the disease transmission process.\",\n",
       " \"Understanding how temperature affects disease-causing organisms and the mosquitoes that carry them is critical for predicting and responding to future changes in disease risk. Many of the world's most devastating and neglected infectious diseases require mosquitoes and other insects for transmission between people. Malaria kills over 650,000 people each year, mostly children in sub-Saharan Africa, and pathogens like West Nile virus, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus are on the rise in both North America and the tropics. Mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry are sensitive to the environment, so changes in climate, particularly temperature, affect disease risk both in the tropics and in temperate areas. This award supports research to measure the effect of temperature on 13 different pathogens that use mosquitoes and flies for transmission, and the capacity for two common mosquitoes in the Americas to adapt to different temperature conditions. In addition, this work will support STEM education through training in science and math with a focus on under-represented groups, and will contribute publicly available data that can be used by other researchers and public health professionals.  The goal of this project is to develop a general framework for predicting the temperature sensitivity of vector transmission. This work addresses three main questions: (1) How does vector-borne pathogen transmission respond to temperature? (2) How important is the influence of temperature, relative to other factors, on transmission in the field? (3) Can such transmission adapt to local temperature regimes? The research will develop temperature-sensitive transmission models and fit them with data from the existing literature for 13 vector-borne diseases: vivax malaria, trypanosomiasis, dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile, Eastern equine encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, Ockelbo (Sindbis) disease, Ross River fever, and bluetongue. Laboratory experiments will measure local thermal adaptation of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, which transmit dengue and other viruses, from across their geographic and temperature ranges. In tandem, the research will develop and test theory on how vectors and parasites respond to temperature based on theory from physiological ecology. New local-scale data collected in Ecuador on transmission risk, dengue cases, climate, and other social and economic factors will be used to validate the model predictions. Complementing these local-scale data, the research will develop a global database on field transmission from the existing literature, along with climatic and socioeconomic information. Together, these field data will test the accuracy of the transmission models and assess the relative importance of temperature for transmission at scales from neighborhood to continent.\",\n",
       " 'Most new infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic, which means the pathogens that cause these diseases originate in wild and domestic animals and then spread to humans. Many pathogens that infect livestock and wildlife species are also found in other species. Mathematical models that describe pathogen transmission within single wildlife host species (e.g., rabies transmission within bat populations) and between different host species (e.g., rabies transmission between bats and skunks) are critical tools for understanding and predicting disease outbreaks in humans, livestock, and wildlife. In addition to being used to understand the spread of pathogens among hosts, these same models can be used to understand the spread of beneficial symbionts (small organisms such as bacteria that live in much larger hosts) that help rather than harm the host.  However, the fundamental assumptions that underlie these mathematical models are rarely tested, because observing animal contact rates and spread of disease in nature is difficult. This research will use a system of hosts and their symbionts to test assumptions on which the existing models are built, and will quantify how well those models can predict disease transmission in wildlife populations.  The results of this research will ultimately lead to mathematical models that are better at predicting symbiont transmission.   Wildlife population densities often vary across space and time. Classic epidemiological models use one of two mechanistic transmission functions to describe the relationship between host density and pathogen transmission rates. The first assumes that animal contact rates and thus transmission rates increase linearly with host density (density-dependent transmission), and the second assumes that animal contact rates and transmission rates are not affected by host density (frequency-dependent transmission). However, nonlinear relationships that fall somewhere between those extremes may be more appropriate in many host-symbiont systems. Using an experimentally tractable multi-host system - symbiotic annelid worms living on freshwater snails - this research will: (1) empirically quantify the relationship between host density and both intra- and inter-specific host contact rates, and (2) use the resulting model to make and test predictions regarding symbiont transmission dynamics in single and multi-host host communities at broad spatial and temporal scales in natural systems. Critical evaluation of fundamental model assumptions and the resulting model predictions will lead to better predictive models of symbiont transmission.',\n",
       " 'The spread of pathogens in swine populations has negative effects on both animal and human health. For example, the introduction of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in North America in April 2013 has caused significant economic losses to the US swine industry. PEDV is transmitted via the fecal-oral route and the nature and extent to which between-farm transmission is influenced by truck movements between farms, and between farms and feed plants, is yet to be determined. In addition, influenza A virus (IAV) not only negatively affects the health and productivity of domestic swine populations, but influenza has a major impact on human health. Influenza virus is transmitted via aerosol, is endemic in swine populations, and pork producers today perceive economic value in enhancing biosecurity for public health purposes. However, little is known about the effects of various interventions on IAV transmission. Mathematical models are powerful tools to understand transmission and develop control strategies for infectious diseases. Here we are in a unique situation to utilize cutting-edge modeling approaches on already collected (and emerging) data on pathogen transmission to help design effective mitigation strategies for the spread of swine pathogens. The main goal of this project is to stimulate collaboration between a new team of modelers and empiricists to reduce fecal-oral (PEDV) and airborne (IAV) transmission, which will ultimately benefit both animal and human health. The overall objective of this study is to construct a flexible modeling framework to simulate the spread of primarily fecal-oral and airborne infectious pathogens between swine herds, through the following specific aims:Utilize network approaches to formulate a between-farm transmission model.Create an integrated model of regional pathogen spread.Simulate PEDV and IAV transmission and test different control strategies to reduce pathogen spread.This model can be utilized to understand, mitigate, and prevent PEDV and IAV transmission as well as to quantify the effect of alternative strategies in the control of other food-borne and airborne pathogens. The ultimate focus of the proposed project is to give feedback to producers on ways to reduce transmission within and among swine herds.',\n",

       " 'Objective(s): Objective 1:  Perform risk assessment of bacterial pathogen transmission by house flies. Sub-objective 1.A: Develop more effective larval control techniques by understanding the role of microbes in larval development and fitness. Sub-objective 1.B: Evaluate the role of fly-bacteria and bacteria-bacteria interactions in house fly pathogen transmission.  Objective 2:  Determine biological characteristics of mosquito vectors influencing animal health in a changing climate. Sub-objective 2.A: Model mosquito ecological niches and impact of climate change.  Sub-objective 2.B: Characterize the biology of discrete mosquito populations.  Objective 3:  Develop methods to reduce biting midge transmission of animal pathogens. Sub-objective 3.A: Identify and characterize the salivary protein components of Culicoides sonorensis.  Sub-objective 3.B: Identify potential Culicoides vectors of epizootic hemorrhagic disease and bluetongue. Sub-objective 3.C: Determine breeding site characteristics of Culicoides spp.. Sub-objective 3.D: Evaluate efficacy of candidate pesticides against C. sonorensis.  Approach: An extremely small percentage of insect species transmit disease-causing pathogens to animals and humans. Specific biological and behavioral characteristics allow these vector insect species to be efficient means of pathogen propagation and transmission; however these same characteristics may be targeted by control measures to limit pathogen spread or disease vector abundance. The common purpose of these projects is to understand key components of the host-pathogen-vector cycle to reduce or prevent pathogen transmission by the most common disease vectors: house flies, mosquitoes, and biting midges (Fig. 1). House flies associate with bacteria-rich environments due to the nutritional requirements of their larvae. This research defines the role of bacteria in fly development, bacterial persistence during microbe and insect interactions, and pathogen dissemination. Natural selection for increased Culex tarsalis mosquito fitness for various habitats and animal hosts has left genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms) throughout the genome. These markers can be associated with traits and used to predict regional entomological risk in a changing climate throughout the mosquito’s large geographic range. The identification of biting midges or Culicoides saliva components that facilitate pathogen transmission will lead to improved transmission and pathogenesis models. This information will enhance development of vaccines and other countermeasures to reduce disease transmission. Lastly, not all Culicoides are competent vectors and this study will determine vector species and their habitats to help estimate risk in specific geographic regions. This plan aims to limit pathogen transmission by targeting the connections between hosts, vectors, and their environments via the insects’ unique characteristics using novel disease control methods.',\n",
       " 'Studies on asexual stage immunity to P. falciparum 1. Evaluate the merozoite antigen PfRH5 as a vaccine candidate. Previously we have collaborated with investigators in LIG to show that antibodies to RH5 isolated from those living in Mali are able to inhibit parasite invasion of red cells (GIA activity), lending support to this protein as a new vaccine candidate. Interestingly, Malian sera has very low levels of antibodies to this antigen. Our collaborators at Oxford University are pursuing this protein as a vaccine candidate and,as a prelude to that, have conducted an immunization-challenge trial in Aotus monkeys. We have collaborated on evaluating GIA activity in sera from the monkeys with PfRH5 and these results have been published; the promising results have supported proceeding to a human clinical trial which has recently been completed and we are currently analyzing these sera. Also we have evaluated the GIA activity of antibodies to both RH5 and the RIPr protein (RH5 interacting protein) which appear together on the surface of the invading merozoite. Each protein elicits strong GIA activity2. Investigate other targets of merozoite immunity - AMA1While AMA1 is a prominent vaccine candidate, it has two issues:1) antigenic polymorphism so that antibody responses tend to be strain-specific and 2) insufficient antibody production to result in protective immunity in humans. Our data as well as that of our collaborators supports the use of a mixture of 4-5 different AMA1 alleles to overcome the polymorphism and elicit broadly reactive antibodies. Further, we have collaborated with LMVR investigators (Dr. Louis Miller) to show that using AMA1 in conjunction with its partner protein RON2 produces antibodies with greater activity in a standardized parasite growth inhibition assay (GIA). This complex is required for triggering junction formation between the merozoite and the red cell surface. Evaluation of this combination in an immunization-challenge trial in a non-human primate (Aotus) has been conducted and we have provided supportive GIA data for a human clinical trial.3. Studies of immunity to malaria in Kenieroba, Mali. Our 4-year investigation of the acquisition of immunity to malaria in Malian children represents perhaps the most detailed longitudinal  study of malaria in African children that has been conducted, and it details the critical impact of the sickle cell trait (HbAS) in protection against malaria. We have previously evaluated the antibody responses of these children in several different assays including ELISA,GIA, and antibodies to variant surface antigens on malaria-infected red cells (VSA). In 2014-2015 we collaborated with others to broaden the scope of anti-parasite functional activities and have added the neutrophil-dependent antibody-dependent respiratory burst assay. A manuscript on this is in press.4. We continue to work with Dr. Amy Bei and Dr. Dyann Wirth of Harvard University, who are studying changes in frequency of different P.falciparum clones over time in Senegal. We have worked with them to examine the influence of human immune responses on the changes in clonal parasite patterns, particularly related to the observation of parasites with common genetic signatures. The first results of these studies using GIA and the VSA assay were published this year and an expanded study is in progress.Studies on parasite sexual stages and malaria transmission:1.) Develop quantitative methodology for analysis of the standard mosquito membrane feeding assay (SMFA) to evaluate transmission blocking activity and extend this to parasites in the field. The gold standard assay to evaluate the ability of antibodies to block transmission to mosquitoes is the SMFA, and we have performed an in depth study of this assay to define its characteristics in order to have confidence in  assessing potential transmission blocking vaccine (TBV) candidates. We have shown that the SMFA is quite reproducible at high concentrations of antibody but highly variable at low concentrations and we have worked with the Biostatistics group at NIAID to develop a computer model of the assay. In 2014-2015 we have extended our collaboration with this group to show that we can predict the impact of a specific antibody on the reduction of P. falciparum parasite prevalence in mosquitoes from the reduction in oocysts in an SMFA and from the number of oocysts in the control mosquitoes. This is important because reduction in malaria prevalence in mosquitoes by an antibody is key to reducing transmission.2.) Search for and evaluate new possible transmission blocking vaccine candidates. Using SMFA in 2014-2015 we have evaluated a number of potential transmission blocking vaccine candidates. In collaboration with colleagues at Oxford University we have produced and tested a number of known and unknown sexual stage proteins from P. falciparum. These proteins have been produced in HEK293 cells and the products have been used to immunize mice. Sera from these animals have been evaluated in the SMFA but none have shown high levels of oocyst inhibition in this assay.3.) Assess the presence of asexual and sexual stage parasites in residents of Kenieroba, Mali throughout the year. In the spring of 2013 we initiated a new study (NIH 13-I-N107) of malaria transmission to address the limited information on transmission in malaria endemic areas, and in 2014 we completed the field aspect of this study. Volunteers representing all age groups were finger pricked twice per month for 1 year to collect DNA and RNA. During the 2014-2015 year we completed analysis of over 10,000 samples of parasite DNA on filter paper. In October 2013 (middle of the wet season), P. falciparum prevalence in the cohort was 48.0%, and in March 2014 (middle of the dry season), the prevalence dropped to 18.0%. We also analyzed the longitudinal prevalence of the cohort; we observed that the 9-12 years old age group had the highest median longitudinal prevalence (38.1%) compared to the other age groups, and males had a higher median (33.3%) than females (22.0%). By a linear regression model, only age and gender showed significant effects on the longitudinal prevalence (p<0.0001 and p=0.0008, respectively), while other host factors did not. There are few studies of longitudinal prevalence of parasites and we are preparing these results for publication.4.) Using the RNA collections from the same study, we are using a qRT-PCR procedure to identify Pfs25 mRNA specific for gametocytes. In 2014-2015 we have completed part of the RNA analysis; these results will allow us to identify those individuals capable of malaria transmission who might be targeted for intervention. 5.) Determine whether Kenieroba residents develop antibodies which have blocking activity in SMFA. This study of transmission includes a venipuncture sample from all the volunteers 3 times during the year. These larger volume serum samples are being used in SMFA to determine whether antibodies have transmission blocking activity, particularly after the rainy season. 6.) With support from PATH/MVI, we have begun to evaluate humanized monoclonal antibodies to 3 different sexual/mosquito stage antigens.7.) We have initiated studies to examine the differentiation pattern of P. falciparum gametocytes in culture for 3 weeks using RNASeq techniques. This will be extended to transcripts produced in infected mosquitoes.',\n",

       " 'Human parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3 are significant causes of severe pediatric respiratory tract disease worldwide. The HPIVs are enveloped, non-segmented, negative strand RNA viruses of the family Paramyxoviridae. The broad outlines of their biology and molecular genetics have been defined in previous studies by this laboratory and others. The HPIV genome encodes a nucleoprotein N, phosphoprotein P, large polymerase protein L, internal matrix protein M, and fusion F and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase HN transmembrane surface glycoproteins. F and HN are the two viral neutralization antigens and the major protective antigens. In addition, the P gene encodes various accessory protein(s)from one or more additional ORFs: C (HPIV1), V (HPIV2), and C, D, and possibly V (HPIV3). These accessory proteins have a number of functions that antagonize the host response to viral infection, as described in previous years. We are developing attenuated versions of HPIV1, 2, and 3 that also express the fusion F protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is the most important viral agent of severe pediatric respiratory tract disease, with a contribution to human disease comparable to that of the HPIVs combined, and the F protein is the major RSV neutralization and protective antigen. HPIV1, 2, and 3 expressing the RSV F protein would provide bivalent vaccines against each respective HPIV and RSV. Compared to RSV strains, the HPIVs replicate more efficiently in cell culture and have much greater physical stability. They also form spherical particles compared to the large filaments of RSV, making them more amenable to filtration and other steps in manufacture. These attributes make HPIV vectors much easier to manufacture, distribute, store, and use compared to attenuated RSV strains. The greater physical stability in particular may be essential for extending RSV vaccines to resource-challenged countries. Furthermore, in experimental animals, boosting RSV responses was more efficient using HPIV/RSV vectors as opposed to attenuated RSV strains, since the latter are subject to greater restriction by prior RSV-specific immunity. We have been evaluating a number of parameters of vaccine vector design using, as proof of principle, an attenuated HPIV3 virus called B/HPIV3 This consists of bovine PIV3 in which the F and HN genes have been replaced by those of HPIV3, yielding a chimeric virus that is attenuated in primates due to the bovine backbone and bears the neutralization and major protective F and HN antigens of HPIV3. Previously, B/HPIV3 has been evaluated in clinical phase 1 studies, both as an empty vector (LID/NIAID study) and as a vector for RSV-F (MedImmune study), and was shown to be well-tolerated in either role in infants and young children. In the initial clinical study of B/HPIV3-RSV-F, the RSV F insert exhibited substantial instability and was not as immunogenic as hoped. Our goal therefore has been to increase the immunogenicity and stability of the RSV F insert.We previously evaluated the effects of the position of insertion of the RSV F gene into the B/HPIV3 backbone, and found that the first (pre-N) and second (N-P) gene positions readily accommodated the RSV F insert. This resulted in greatly increased expression of RSV F protein compared to downstream locations (up to 69-fold increase) and greatly increased fusion. Surprisingly, this did not appear to interfere with vector replication in vitro or in hamsters. In the past year, we found that expression of the RSV F protein was further enhanced 5-fold by codon-optimization and by modifying the amino acid sequence to be identical to that of an early passage of the original clinical isolate. This conferred a hypo-fusogenic phenotype that presumably reflects the original clinical isolate, and suggests that this strain of RSV may have mutated to acquire a hyper-fusogenic phenotype during passage in vitro. We then compared vectors expressing stabilized pre- and post-fusion versions of RSV F protein. In a hamster model, pre-fusion F induced increased quantity and quality of RSV-neutralizing serum antibodies and increased protection against wt RSV challenge, compared to native F. In contrast, vector expressing the post-fusion F was more immunogenic and protective than native RSV F, but less than pre-fusion F. Use of a double-staining immunofluorescence assay showed that the stability of expression of the RSV F protein was high and was not affected by enhanced expression or the pre- or post-fusion conformations of RSV F. These studies provide an improved version of the rB/HPIV3-RSV F vaccine candidate that induces a superior RSV-neutralizing serum antibody response.HPIV1 also was developed as a vector for RSV F during the past year. The RSV F gene was inserted individually into three different genome locations (pre-N (F1), N-P (F2), or P-M (F3)) in each of two attenuated rHPIV1 backbones. Each backbone contained a single previously-described attenuating mutation that was stabilized against de-attenuation: (1) a non-temperature-sensitivity deletion mutation involving six nucleotides in the overlapping P/C ORFs (Cdel170), or (2) a temperature-sensitivity missense mutation in the L ORF (LY942A). In vitro, the presence of the F insert reduced the rate of virus replication, but the final titers were the same as wt HPIV1. High levels of RSV F expression in cultured cells were observed with rHPIV1-Cdel170-F1, -F2, and -F3, and rHPIV1-LY942A-F1. In hamsters, the rHPIV1-Cdel170-F1, -F2, and -F3 vectors were moderately restricted in the nasal turbinates and highly restricted in lungs, and were genetically stable in vivo. Among the Cdel170 vectors, the F1 virus was the most immunogenic and protective against wt RSV challenge. The rHPIV1-LY942A vectors were highly restricted in vivo and were not detectably immunogenic or protective, indicative of over-attenuation. The Cdel170-F1 construct appears to be suitably attenuated and immunogenic for further development as a bivalent intranasal pediatric vaccine. We also investigated regulation of gene expression in HPIV3. The gene end (GE) transcription signals of the HPIV3 genes are highly conserved except that the M GE signal contains an apparent 8-nucleotide insert. This is associated with increased synthesis of a read-through transcript of the M gene plus the downstream F protein gene. We hypothesized that this insert may function to down-regulate expression of F protein by interfering with termination/re-initiation at the M-F gene junction, thus promoting the production of M-F read-through mRNA at the expense of monocistronic F mRNA. To test this hypothesis, two similar recombinant HPIV3 viruses were generated from which this insert in the M-GE signal was removed. The M-GE mutants exhibited a reduction in M-F read-through mRNA and an increase in monocistronic F mRNA. This resulted in a substantial increase in F protein synthesis in the infected cells as well as enhanced incorporation of F protein into virions. The efficiency of mutant virus replication was similar to that of wt HPIV3 both in vitro and in vivo. However, the F protein-specific serum antibody response in hamsters was increased for the mutants as compared to wt HPIV3. This study identifies a novel viral mechanism for reducing stimulation of the host adaptive immune response. Repairing the M-GE signal should provide a means to increase the antibody response to a live attenuated HPIV3 vaccine without affecting viral replication and attenuation.',\n",
       " 'Human Immunity to MalariaThe first Kenieroba study (08-I-N120) was completed in 2012 and focused on: 1) Whether Malian children with various hemoglobin and red cell polymorphisms are protected from clinical Plasmodium falciparum malaria; 2) Developing a profile of the acquisition of malaria immunity in Malian children; 3) Examining aspects of pathogenesis due to malaria in Malian children and adults. To initiate these investigations, we conducted a 4-year longitudinal study of 1500 children ranging in age from 6 months to 18 years. All the enrolled children were typed for a series of these red cell and hemoglobin polymorphisms. After diagnosis and treatment of 4207 episodes of malaria, we have developed a very detailed profile of age-dependent acquisition of resistance to malaria in this population. We have shown that sickle cell trait (HbAS) confers greater protection against malaria than other RBC polymorphisms, and a complete analysis was published in 2015. In addition, we continue to analyze a series of samples collected throughout the study.  For example, we are testing the ability of sera from these children to limit parasitemias using an antibody-dependent respiratory burst assay.An additional clinical study in Kenieroba was completed in 2015 in conjunction with Dr. Michael Walther, formerly of LMIV (13-I-N209).The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that co-administration of IV artesunate (AS) and oral activated charcoal (oAC) is not inferior to administration of IV AS alone, with regard to the parasite half-life in children presenting with uncomplicated malaria. To show this we enrolled 35 children into each of two arms, AS + oAC and AS + water. During two transmissions seasons we enrolled 71 children with 70 completing the study. Initial comparative analysis of the two groups showed that there was no significant difference in parasite clearance rate between the two arms indicating that co-administration of IV AS and oAC was not inferior to the administration of IV AS alone. Additionally, there was no difference in the reportable adverse events between the two groups. This data provides the basis for determining whether oAC co-administration with AS can reduce severe malaria in children.Malaria Transmission Transmission of malaria is a critical aspect of the parasite life cycle but is poorly understood, so that we have increased our efforts to investigate parasite sexual stages, malaria transmission in the field, and the biology of the mosquito vector. In May of 2014 we completed a clinical protocol studying 500 individuals of all ages in Kenieroba (13-I-N107). Volunteers were finger-pricked twice per month for a year to analyze both DNA and RNA; in addition, sera were collected by venipuncture three times during the year. This past year we applied the protocols we had previously developed for analysis of parasite DNA by PCR directly on filter paper and we have completed testing of all the samples (>10,000). Using more sensitive molecular methods rather than slide reading, we have found that a relatively high proportion of individuals of all ages carry malaria parasites - in October 2013 (middle of the wet season), P. falciparum prevalence in the cohort was 48.0%, and in March 2014 (middle of the dry season), the prevalence dropped to 18.0%. By a linear regression model, only age and gender showed significant effects on the longitudinal prevalence (p<0.0001 and p=0.0008, respectively), while other host factors did not. In addition, we have established methods for quantitation of gametocyte mRNA encoding Pfs25 using RT-PCR with the RNA samples and we are determining the proportion of parasite positive individuals with gametocytes throughout the year. In addition, selected serum samples are being tested for the capacity to inhibit transmission in membrane feeding assays to determine whether those living in endemic areas develop antibodies that can block transmission and whether they recognize specific sexual stage antigens. Strategies to impact malaria transmission will be accelerated by a better understanding of those individuals primarily responsible for transmission to mosquito vectors. P. falciparum and evasion of mosquito immune systemWe had obtained experimental evidence that some African strains of P. falciparum can evade the mosquito immune system resulting in more effective transmission and Pfs47 was identified as the malaria gene that allows the parasite to infect mosquitoes without being targeted for destruction.  We are testing the hypothesis that the polymorphic Pfs47 gene must interact with a mosquito gene to disrupt the immune response of the vector and that different alleles of Pfs47 work better to evade the immune system of certain mosquito vectors.  If this hypothesis is correct, we expect that the different mosquito vectors in Africa will preferentially transmit parasites with certain alleles of Pfs47.  The team in Mali has collected mosquitoes from homes using the  spray-catch  method and performed ELISA assays to identify P. falciparum infected mosquitoes.  Material from infected mosquitoes was sent to NIH, genomic DNA was extracted, the Pfs47 gene was sequenced, and the mosquito vectors were typed using molecular tools. We had received a total of 212 mosquito samples sent from Mali and we sequenced the Pfs47 D2 domain (the most variable region) in 150 samples. Two of the 11 haplotypes identified in mosquitoes with a single infection were the most frequent, representing 55 and 18% of the samples; the largest diversity of the 11 haplotypes was found in the month of October. While we did not find a significant difference in the frequency of Pfs47 haplotypes between A. coluzzi and A. gambiae mosquitoes, we are examining other species.  An exciting new observation this past year was the finding of naturally occurring Wolbachia infection in Mali.  Wolbachia is a bacteria commonly found in various arthropods and is being studied as a vehicle to control insect populations. We are currently obtaining blood-fed females from the field to establish colonies of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and study how they interact with the mosquito immune system and Plasmodium falciparum. Dry season ecology of malaria vectorsOur main efforts have focused on (1) long distance migration of mosquitoes as a means of re-colonization of Sahelian villages after population extinction during the dry season, and (2) understanding the strategies of persistence of A. coluzzii in the Sahel throughout the dry season. Building on previous results, we have amassed additional compelling evidence that A. coluzzii (previously the M form of A. gambiae) persists locally by aestivation whereas A. gambiae (previously the S form) and A. arabiensis re-colonize the area after the onset of rains. Current major efforts in the field aim to provide direct evidence for these elusive phenomena. Our project on long distance migration combines (i) on-the-ground monitoring of vector density and composition along two transects, over 200 km long, with (ii) aerial sampling of mosquitoes using traps tethered to helium filled balloons. This year, we extended the aerial sample up to 300 m above ground. So far 3 A. gambiae s.l. mosquitoes have been found among other mosquito species. In addition we have established bio-assays to measure flight aptitude of mosquitoes aiming at identifying long-distance migrants on the ground. Both tethered flight assay and free flight assay are currently applied in Mali. Preliminary results show an expected increase in flight activity correlated temporally with presence of A. gambiae in aerial samples. Upon completion of this years fieldwork, we plan to publish the firstreport of wind-assisted long distance migration of malaria vectors. These findings have important implications for malaria transmission and control',\n",
       " 'The most frequent route of HIV transmission occurs across mucosal tissues. Unfortunately, the earliest events in mucosal transmission are poorly defined. Two features of transmission stand out. First, mucosal transmission is inefficient. Second, in the majority of newly infected individuals the virus rapidly establishes infection in gut associated lymphoid compartments. We regard a comprehensive understanding of these two aspects of mucosal transmission as critically important information that can be utilized in the development of an effective HIV vaccine. HIV must overcome multiple structural barriers and only achieves productive infection upon gaining access to metabolically active CD4+ T cells. This process requires that the HIV envelope protein first binds to the CD4 receptor and subsequently to a co-receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4). However, the CD4 receptor is expressed at high levels not just on metabolically activated cells, but also on resting cells, which are a poor substrate for productive infection. We have identified the integrin &#945;4&#946;7 as an additional HIV receptor on the surface of CD4+ T cells. &#945;4&#946;7 is not an entry receptor, however, unlike CD4, integrin &#945;4-&#946;7 is preferentially expressed on a subset of cells in mucosal tissues that are activated. We are addressing the hypothesis that a direct interaction between gp120 and &#945;4&#946;7 expressing cells provides important advantages that facilitate transmission across mucosal surfaces. By engaging these cells, a virion is effectively targeting a subset of CD4+ T cells that is relatively more susceptible to infection. In the past year, using an SIV/macaque model we have shown that targeting these cells with and antibody to &#945;4&#946;7 reduces the efficiency of transmission in a significant way. We continue to pursue the goal of better understanding the specific molecular events surrounding mucosal transmission because we regard this as critical information that will allow us to identify new strategies to prevent HIV transmission.',\n",
       " 'The primary goal is to perform pediatric clinical studies to identify a live attenuated vaccine against RSV. We also have performed or are performing clinical studies for HPIV1, HPIV2, HPIV3, and HMPV candidates. In the future, studies with the HPIVs will be restricted to strains that also express RSV antigen as bivalent vaccines. All vaccine viruses are developed and produced from cloned cDNAs using reverse genetic systems of our making and employ defined attenuating mutations of our making. We develop candidates in pre-clinical studies and prepare vaccine seeds. Vaccine manufacture is performed under contact under our supervision, and clinical evaluation is performed by contract or collaboration under our supervision. Vaccines are evaluated clinically beginning in adults (who are seropositive for these common viruses), and moving successively to seropositive older children (typically 12-59 months of age) followed by seronegative younger children and infants (typically 6 -24 months of age for RSV, 6-59 months of age for the others). For RSV and HPIV3, viruses may be evaluated further in virus-naive young infants 1-3 months of age. Adult studies are open-label, whereas pediatric studies are double-blind placebo-controlled with a 2:1 ratio of vaccine to placebo recipients. For all RSV studies, subjects are followed during the subsequent RSV season (Nov 01 to March 31) following the experimental immunization in order to assess the longevity of the antibody response and the rate and severity of natural RSV infection (although these studies are too small to reliably assess protective efficacy), and to confirm the absence of enhanced RSV disease. RSV vaccine: We previously made an RSV vaccine candidate called RSV delM2-2 that is based on deletion of most of the ORF encoding the M2-2 protein. This mutation down-regulated viral RNA replication and up-regulated viral gene transcription and antigen synthesis, raising the possibility of increased immunogenicity. In addition, deletion of an ORF should be refractory to reversion or compensation, providing increased genetic and phenotypic stability. We performed a phase 1 clinical study (NCT01459198) of a version of this mutant whose seed virus was supplied by MedImmune and is called RSV MEDI delM2-2. In seronegative children, and compared to our previous lead RSV vaccine candidate rA2cp248/404/1030delSH, the delM2-2- virus was significantly more restricted for shedding in nasal washes but induced significantly higher titers of RSV neutralizing serum antibodies. Thus, it indeed appeared to have increased immunogenicity per infectious unit. In this particular trial, there was an unusually high incidence of adventitious infections by other respiratory viruses in both the vaccine and the placebo groups, which confounded evaluation of tolerability. Surveillance during the subsequent RSV season showed that several RSV MEDI&#8710;M2-2 recipients had substantial antibody rises without reported illness, suggesting that the vaccine was protective yet primed for anamnestic responses to RSV. Rational design appears to have yielded a candidate RSV vaccine that is intrinsically superior at eliciting protective antibodies in RSV-nave children, and highlights a new approach for the development of live-attenuated RSV vaccines. We presently are conducting a second phase 1 study in 51 additional seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT02040831). This study involves a version of the delM2-2 virus that was derived in our laboratory and is called RSV LID delM2-2. Part of this study is being done in collaboration with the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group.The rA2cp248/404/1030delSH virus mentioned above contains a series of point mutations and deletion of the SH gene, and is highly temperature-sensitive, but exhibits genetic instability involving at least two attenuating mutations. We previously developed a new version of this virus, called cps2, in which these two mutations have been modified for increased genetic stability. RSV cps2 is presently in a phase 1 study in seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT01852266). This study involves 51 subjects, and part of this study is being done with IMPAACT.We also previously developed another RSV vaccine candidate called RSV delNS2del1313. This virus contains the deletion of the nonstructural protein-2 (NS2) gene, which encodes a protein that antagonizes host responses to viral infection, notably the type I interferon (IFN) response. It also contains deletion of codon 1313 in the polymerase L protein. This virus presently is being evaluated in a phase 1 study in 30 seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT01893554). Thus, we have three promising RSV platforms in phase 1 studies: RSV delM2-2, RSV cps2, and RSV delNS2del1313. These viruses have different properties (such as temperature-sensitivity and differences in antigen expression) and different mechanisms of attenuation (involving effects on RNA synthesis, regulation of RNA synthesis, IFN antagonism, among others). Our goal is to expeditiously identify a suitable live attenuated RSV candidate to bring forward into larger studies. The RSV delM2-2 virus appears to be particularly promising. Wild type (WT) RSV:We prepared a clinical trial lot of WT RSV strain A2 produced from cDNA. This provides a virus with a well-defined passage history and reduced possibility of adventitious agents. This virus will be evaluated for infectivity, replication, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity in adult volunteers. This will provide an infection model that can be used to evaluate antiviral drug candidates and vaccine candidates, and to study viral pathogenesis and the host response. HPIV3 vaccine: We previously developed and evaluated an attenuated version of HPIV3 called rHPIV3 cp45. This is a recombinant version of a biologically derived cold-passaged (cp) virus that we previously showed has satisfactory infectivity, safety, immunogenicity, and lack of transmissibility in seronegative infants and children in phase 1 and 2 studies. LID re-derived this virus from cDNA to provide a known pedigree for safety reasons. This virus was indistinguishable from its biological parent in a phase 1 study in seronegative infants and children, and thus is available to take to larger studies and combine with an RSV candidate when the optimal candidate is identified. We previously evaluated a combination of HPIV3 cp45 plus an attenuated RSV strain in a phase 1 study in seronegative children and showed that the two viruses were compatible, and that the bivalent vaccine was well-tolerated and immunogenic. A second HPIV3 vaccine based on bovine PIV3 in which the F and HN genes were replaced with their counterparts from HPIV3 also has been evaluated in seronegative infants and children and was attenuated, well-tolerated, and immunogenic.HPIV1 vaccine: We previously developed an HPIV1 vaccine candidate called rHPIV1-C(R84G/del170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) that includes mutations that were engineered for genetic stability. A phase 1 study in seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (NCT00641017) showed that this virus is over-attenuated. Over-attenuation can be corrected by reverse genetics. HPIV2 vaccine: We previously developed an HPIV2 vaccine candidate called rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/1724 that includes stabilized mutations. This virus presently is being evaluated in a phase 1 study in seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age (NCT01139437). HMPV vaccine: We previously developed an HMPV vaccine virus called rHMPV-Pa in which the HMPV P gene was replaced by that of avian MPV, thus conferring a host range attenuation phenotype. This virus is presently being evaluated in a phase 1 study in seronegative children 6-59 months of age (NCT01255410).',\n",
       " 'Plague is a zoonosis that is present in wild rodent populations worldwide and is transmitted primarily by fleas. Yersinia pestis, the plague bacillus, is unique among the enteric group of gram-negative bacteria in having adopted an arthropod-borne route of transmission. Y. pestis has evolved in such a way as to be transmitted during the brief encounter between a feeding flea and a host. A transmissible infection primarily depends on the ability of Y. pestis to grow in the flea as a biofilm that is embedded in a complex extracellular matrix. Bacteria in the biofilm phenotype are deposited into the dermis together with flea saliva, elements which cannot be satisfactorily mimicked by needle-injection of Y. pestis from laboratory cultures. The objective of this project is to identify and determine the function of Y. pestis genes that mediate flea-borne transmission and the initial encounter with the host innate immune system at the infection site in the skin. We study the interaction of Y. pestis with its insect vector by using an artificial feeding apparatus to infect fleas with uniform doses of wild-type or specific Y. pestis mutants. We seek to identify Y. pestis genes that are required for the bacteria to infect the flea midgut and to produce a biofilm that blocks the flea foregut and that is required for efficient transmission. The strategy entails first identifying bacterial genes that are differentially expressed in the flea by gene expression analysis and other techniques. Specific mutations are then introduced into these genes, and the mutants tested for their ability to infect and block the flea vector. Identification of such transmission factors allows further studies into the molecular mechanisms of the bacterial infection of the flea vector. Detailed understanding of the interaction with the insect host may lead to novel strategies to interrupt the transmission cycle. Our studies of flea vector competence and vectorial capacity will be useful to develop more realistic mathematical modeling of the epidemiology of plague transmission and the conditions that lead to plague epizootics.     During FY2015, we continued to investigate the regulation of Y. pestis genes required for the biofilm life stage in the flea vector.  We previously reported that a major bacterial gene regulatory system (known as PhoP-PhoQ) is induced during infection of the flea vector and is required to produce a normal transmissible infection.  Because PhoP-PhoQ upregulates several genes required for bacterial resistance to innate immunity, induction of the PhoP-PhoQ system in the arthropod vector prior to transmission may preadapt Y. pestis to resist the initial encounter with the mammalian innate immune response.  This year, we published the results of microarray experiments that compared the in vitro and in vivo (i.e., in the flea) transcriptomes of wild-type and phoP-negative Y. pestis.  The analysis indicated that the PhoPQ signal transduction-gene regulatory system is induced by low pH in the flea gut, and that PhoP modulates gene expression leading to physiological adaptation to acid and other stresses encountered during infection of the flea.We also continue to investigate the genetic changes that led to the evolutionarily recent transition of Y. pestis to an arthropod-borne transmission route. Y. pseudotuberculosis, the recent ancestor of Y. pestis, causes acute toxicity and 30-40% mortality to fleas that ingest it in a blood meal.  In contrast, Y. pestis is not orally toxic to fleas, indicating that an ancestral insecticidal toxin was lost, and that this was important in the recent adaption to the flea-borne transmission route.  In FY2015 we completed a project that identified the Yersinia urease enzyme as the toxic factor.  All Y. pestis are urease-negative because ureD is a pseudogene; our work indicates that loss of urease activity was positively selected during the evolution of Y. pestis because it increased flea-borne transmission potential.  This provided another specific example of how gene loss appears to have played a significant role in Y. pestis evolution.In collaboration with the Genomics Unit of the RML Research Technologies Branch, we are examining and characterizing the transcriptomes of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and our biofilm-producing Y. pseudotuberculosis mutant during growth in vitro and during infection of the flea, with the goal of identifying genes and gene regulatory pathways that are important for flea-borne transmission. The in vivo and in vitro transcriptomic comparisons between these three strains are designed to broadly identify candidate components of biofilm regulatory pathways and other genes important for the recent evolutionary adaptation to flea-borne transmission. Significant differences in the expression of orthologous genes in the flea might be indicative of evolutionary changes in gene regulatory pathways.This year we have completed a study on the vector competence of the cat flea Ctenocephalides felis. We used a new experimental system to quantitate the CFUs transmitted by cohorts of fleas as well as individual fleas over a four-week period following a standardized infectious blood meal.  This allowed us to compare the relative efficiency of two mechanisms by which fleas transmit Y. pestis: biofilm-independent early-phase transmission during the first few days after the infectious blood meal and proventricular biofilm-dependent transmission, which occurs from 1-4 weeks after the infectious blood meal. These data will improve mathematical models used to assess the relative importance of the two transmission mechanisms in plague ecology.  These results will be published in FY2016.',\n",
       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and small children. RSV infection in mice is characterized by significant immunopathology which is mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Past studies have suggested that CD8+ T cells with different functional properties and characteristics can be elicited following infection or immunization, and may have differential effects on viral clearance and RSV-associated illness. We have described differences between neonatal and adult CD8+ T cell responses elicited during RSV infection. Differences in clonotype, functional avidity, and other intrinsic parameters of the CD8+ T cell response may help dictate the epitope hierarchy established following infection. We have now defined the dynamics of lung-migratory dendritic cell populations in the lung and lung-draining lymph nodes of RSV-infected mice during early life as compared to adulthood and have determined lung dendritic cell populations that induce RSV-specific adaptive T cell responses following infection. These dendritic cells were found to induce T cell responses in an age-dependent manner, and we have implicated lower costimulatory molecule expression by neonatal dendritic cells as one mechanism for this difference. Our work in the last year has been greatly aided by continuing characterization of three strains of transgenic mice with CD8+ T cells specific for RSV.  Co-culture of transgenic CD8+ T cells of different specificities with dendritic cell populations has allowed us to measure their ability to induce T cell responses in both an age and epitope-specific manner.  We have also initiated studies using MCMV vectors to induce RSV-specific T cell responses.  This will allow us to look at T cells elicited during chronic infection and better understand their contribution to clearance and/or immunopathology following RSV infection. Finally, we have collaborated with a group at Leiden Institute of Chemistry to investigate mechanisms of controlling CD8+ T cell recognition using chemical methods.  These types of approaches can be useful for controlling the induction and function of CD8+ T cells.  Continued work on this study will fully characterize CD8+ T responses to RSV, elucidate important factors that dictate the type of CD8+ T cell response that is generated, and help understand how other cell types regulate the CD8+ T cell response in an age-dependent fashion.',\n",
       " 'Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are cytoplasmic enveloped RNA viruses of the paramyxovirus family, pneumovirus genus. Their genomes are single strands of negative-sense RNA of 15.2 kb (RSV) or 13.3 kb (HMPV) that encode 10 mRNAs and 11 unique proteins (RSV) or 8 mRNAs and 9 unique proteins (HMPV). Each virus encodes a nucleoprotein N, phosphoprotein P, matrix protein M, small hydrophobic protein SH, major glycoprotein G, fusion glycoprotein F, polymerase factors M2-1 and M2-2, and the polymerase protein L. In addition, RSV encodes two nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2. Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) is a close relative of RSV whose natural host is the mouse and which provides a convenient permissive animal model. In last years report, we described the strategy of codon-pair deoptimization (CPD) as a means of developing genetically and phenotypically stable attenuated RSV strains. We continue to characterize these RSV strains. We also are presently completing studies in which the same strategy was applied to PVM, which provides an opportunity to observe the effects of this strategy in a fully permissive host. These RSV and HMPV studies will be described in next years report.Another ongoing project of the past several years has been to (i) investigate possible means of increasing the immunogenicity of RSV vaccine candidates that are based on deletion of the M2-2 ORF or the NS2 gene, and (ii) development of further candidates containing either of these two deletions combined with various other mutations, to provide graded differences in the level of attenuation. This project is still in progress and will be reported next year.We collaborated with Dr. Jeffrey Gorman, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Queensland, Australia, to perform a proteomic screen of host cell protein expression in response to wild type RSV. This involved analysis of multiple independent biological replicates of RSV-infected and mock-infected  lysates of human airway epithelial A549 cells by two different proteomic strategies. One strategy involved fractionation of lysates by in-solution protein isoelectric focusing (IEF), after which individual fractions were digested using trypsin, subjected to capillary high performance liquid chromatography, and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A second strategy involved analysis of tryptic digests of the unfractionated cellular lysate by an improved MS/MS platform. The two strategies detected the known RSV proteins exclusively in lysates of infected cells, as expected, and in the relative abundances anticipated from previous studies. Unprecedented numbers (3247 - 5010) of host cell protein groups also were quantified, and the infection-specific regulation of a large number (191) of these protein groups was evident based on a stringent false discovery rate cut-off (<1%). Bioinformatic analyses revealed that most of the regulated proteins were potentially regulated by antiviral response pathways involving type I, II, and III interferon, TNF-a, and noncanonical NF-kB2. The regulation of specific protein groups by infection was validated by quantitative Western blotting, and the association of specific protein responses with particular cytokines or response pathways was confirmed by comparable analyses of cytokine-treated A549 cells. This produced the most comprehensive proteomic characterization of host cell responses to RSV available to date. We are presently characterizing responses to RSV mutants, such as mutants lacking the NS1 and/or NS2 accessory protein genes.We also contributed to a large collaborative study, directed by Dr. Fernando Polack (Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University), that investigated factors involved in severe RSV disease in infancy. This large multi-center study evaluated the interaction between TLR4 and environmental factors in RSV disease and identified immune mediators associated with severe illness. Evaluation of infants with RSV bronchiolitis revealed that disease severity was strongly influenced by the TLR4 genotype of the individual and by environmental exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 agonist. RSV-infected infants with severe disease exhibited a high ratio of GATA3 (Th2 master regulator): T-bet (Th1 master regulator), which was associated with a high IL-4/IFN-g ratio in respiratory secretions. This linked severe RSV disease with Th2 polarization. Interestingly, high Th2 polarization was associated with low environmental LPS and with polymorphisms in TLR4 associated with hypo-responsiveness. This is consistent with the expectation that low activation of TLR4 contributes to a Th2 bias. Murine models of RSV infection confirmed that LPS exposure, TLR4 genotype, and Th2 polarization influence disease phenotypes. Together, the results of this study identify environmental and genetic factors that influence RSV pathogenesis and reveal that a high IL-4/IFN-g ratio is associated with severe disease. This identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention.We have been collaborating with Dr. Peter Kwong of the Vaccine Research Center to develop improved subunit vaccines for the HMPV F protein. These studies are in progress and will be reported next year.',\n",
       " 'Novel vector control tools are urgently needed to assist artemisinin resistance containment and malaria elimination efforts in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). Ivermectin mass drug administration (MDA) to humans has been proposed as a novel vector control tool for malaria elimination. Ivermectin at human-relevant concentrations is lethal to over a dozen Anopheles species worldwide. Additionally, ivermectin at mosquito sublethal concentrations reduces malaria transmission in the African vector, Anopheles gambiae, by inhibiting Plasmodium falciparum development in the vector, delaying mosquito time to re-feed, reducing fecundity, causing a knockdown effect and delay in recovery, and compounding mosquito mortality following multiple sublethal ivermectin blood meals. To date, no other vector control tool has demonstrated such wide-ranging effects against variables of vector transmission of malaria. In three West African countries, ivermectin MDA has been shown to reduce wild Anopheles gambiae survivorship up to 1 week and the proportion of P. falciparum-transmitting An. gambiae up to 2 weeks following MDA. Ivermectin MDA has an immediate community-wide, Plasmodium transmission suppressing effect by directly targeting the extant, human-feeding Anopheles population regardless of vector temporal or spatial blood-feeding proclivities, thus making ivermectin MDA a new paradigm for vector control. In the laboratory and in an ongoing clinical trial, ivermectin treatment was demonstrated to be lethal to the two most important GMS vectors, An. dirus and An. minimus. These vectors are difficult to control due to their predilections to feed outdoors and before the time that people are protected by their bed nets. However, ivermectin MDA would make human blood meals lethal to mosquitoes regardless of feeding location or time.Our hypothesis is that ivermectin MDA to humans in southern Thailand will reduce malaria parasite transmission. There are two cluster randomized trials (CRTs) proposed that would be implemented as controlled, interrupted time series: (1) a two-arm trial to assess the impact of three ivermectin MDAs spaced 1 month apart in three villages compared to three control villages, and (2) a three-arm trial to assess the impact of three dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus primaquine with and without ivermectin MDAs spaced 1 month apart with each regimen distributed to two villages compared to two control villages. Both epidemiological (malaria prevalence, gametocytemia, resistant parasite ratios, and hemoglobin concentrations) and entomological (vector composition, density, sporozoite rate, resistant parasite ratios, and blood meal composition) parameters of malaria transmission will be assessed. World Health Organization-endorsed antimalarial drug MDAs with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus primaquine are currently being piloted in the GMS. Ivermectin could be incorporated into this MDA platform to provide direct effects against mosquitoes to suppress malaria transmission. Modeling demonstrates that the addition of ivermectin to antimalarial drug MDAs would accelerate the time to malaria elimination, thus minimizing the number of rounds of MDAs needed to achieve local elimination. There are two clinical trials in progress, in Thailand and Kenya, to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic interaction, and mosquito-lethal efficacy of combinations of dihydroartemisininpiperaquine, primaquine, and ivermectin. The proposed CRTs will provide the rationale for implementation of ivermectin with or without antimalarial MDAs in the GMS to reduce malaria transmission. In the short term, there may be immediate reductions in malaria parasite transmission, and long term, this control measure in conjunction with other measures may lead to the elimination of malaria in the GMS and thus containment of artemisinin resistance.Malaria remains the number one infectious disease priority for the U.S. military and is a Fiscal Year 2015 Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program Topic Area. A reduction in malaria incidence in local civilian populations and partner military forces would directly translate to reduced threat of malaria transmission to U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) forces stationed in the GMS. If artemisinin-resistance is not contained in the GMS, then it has the catastrophic potential to spread to all malaria endemic areas worldwide, which could have a major impact on future U.S. and partner military operations globally, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The proposed CRTs may justify the deployment of ivermectin MDA as a novel vector control tool for malaria elimination to be used in civilian or partner military forces in the GMS, which will establish U.S. medical diplomacy in the GMS, thus meeting the mandate for DoD Global Health Engagements.',\n",
       " 'The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities.',\n",
       " 'AbstractRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in infancy is implicated in asthma development in later childhood.Our group previously has shown that there is a severity-dependent relationship of infant bronchiolitis on therisk and morbidity of early childhood asthma. More recently, using the cohort our group enrolled in theTennessee Children’s Respiratory Initiative (TCRI), we found that a specific RSV genotype was associatedwith enhanced bronchiolitis severity in infants. In our preliminary data, we show that a previously describedmutation in RSV isolates is the current predominant circulating genotype of RSV subgroup A strains. Thismutation is an A to G transition in the 4th nucleotide position of the attachment glycoprotein (G) genetranscription terminator (A4G). We also identified a second mutation of RSV with 2 tandem stop codons for theG gene (2stop-A4G) and infants infected with this RSV mutation had statistically significantly increasedbronchiolitis severity scores compared to infants infected with either the RSV WT genotype (A at the 4thposition in the G gene) or the A4G mutation (one stop codon and G at the 4th position in the G gene).Additional preliminary data reveals that infection with 3 RSV clinical strains isolated from respiratory tractssecretions obtained from infants enrolled in INSPIRE that contained the 2stop-A4G mutation resulted in a Th2predominant phenotype in mice. This 2stop-A4G mutation was also associated with enhanced Th2 cytokineresponse during acute infection in human infants in the INSPIRE birth cohort (Project 1) and increased age 4-6year asthma risk in TCRI. We have published that we have the capability to create chimeric viruses in whichwe can substitute the G and F genes from individual viruses into the RSV A2 backbone and mutate specificregions of those genes using a reverse genetics approach,2-4 giving us the capability to specifically determinethe contribution of 2stop-A4G on host immunity. Our overarching hypotheses for this proposal are thatinfection with RSV strains that contain 2stop-A4G enhance innate and adaptive Th2 immuneresponses, and augment subsequent allergic airway inflammation while exacerbating existing allergen-induced airway inflammation. These studies are paradigm shifting because prior to this project there hasbeen no RSV mutation that has been identified as a risk factor for the development of asthma, and ourpreliminary data strongly supports that RSV 2stop-A4G may be the first described. The proposed experimentswill advance the field in that they will define the mechanisms by which RSV 2stop-A4G controls both the earlyinnate and adaptive Th2 responses. Defining the contribution of RSV 2stop-A4G to infant bronchiolitis andasthma pathogenesis highlights the clinical significance of our studies and may provide a therapeutic targetfor vaccines and precision medicine approaches that focus on this RSV mutation.',\n",
       " 'Antigen discovery has focused on using human serum samples collected from individuals that are naturally exposed to malaria, and who appear to develop effective immunity that prevents gametocytemia, or that blocks parasite transmission to mosquitoes, as tools to identify candidate vaccine antigens. Specifically, serum samples that have activity of interest, are compared to sera that lack this activity, for their ability to select or recognize individual recombinant proteins constructs in P. falciparum expression libraries. Recombinant proteins identified through differential screening are then prepared as immunogens and tested for their ability to induce effective anti-gametocyte or transmission blocking antibodies.1. Phage Display Subtractive Screening was performed using field sera having no transmission blocking activity for negative panning followed by positive panning with four different sera having natural transmission blocking activity individually. Using this approach sixteen different TBV candidates were selected which were recognized by at least two different sera having natural transmission blocking activity. Of this the top three TBV candidates were recognized by all four positive sera.2. Genes corresponding to the top nine candidates were synthesized and cloned into mammalian expression vector for DNA immunization of mice to examine their transmission blocking activity by standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA). 3. Sera and purified IgG from immunized mice for the top candidate showed transmission blocking activity comparable to the positive control Pfs25.4. To examine these candidates further the top three candidates recognized by all four positive sera was expressed in E.coli. 5. We are in collaboration with NMRC to generate phage nanoparticle based vaccines expressing the current TBV antigens Pfs25 and Pfs230 on the surface.6. The E.coli expressed and purified proteins are currently being used to immunize mice either individually or in combination with either Pfs25 or Pfs230. The results from these studies will confirm the transmission blocking activity of the top candidate as well as its ability to add to the activity shown by either Pfs25 or Pfs230.',\n",
       " 'Plague is a zoonosis that is present in wild rodent populations worldwide and is transmitted primarily by fleas. Yersinia pestis, the plague bacillus, is unique among the enteric group of gram-negative bacteria in having adopted an arthropod-borne route of transmission. Y. pestis has evolved in such a way as to be transmitted during the brief encounter between a feeding flea and a host. A transmissible infection primarily depends on the ability of Y. pestis to grow in the flea as a biofilm that is embedded in a complex extracellular matrix. Bacteria in the biofilm phenotype are deposited into the dermis together with flea saliva, elements which cannot be satisfactorily mimicked by needle-injection of Y. pestis from laboratory cultures. The objective of this project is to identify and determine the function of Y. pestis genes that mediate flea-borne transmission and the initial encounter with the host innate immune system at the infection site in the skin. We study the interaction of Y. pestis with its insect vector by using an artificial feeding apparatus to infect fleas with uniform doses of wild-type or specific Y. pestis mutants. We seek to identify Y. pestis genes that are required for the bacteria to infect the flea midgut and to produce a biofilm that blocks the flea foregut and that is required for efficient transmission. The strategy entails first identifying bacterial genes that are differentially expressed in the flea by gene expression analysis and other techniques. Specific mutations are then introduced into these genes, and the mutants tested for their ability to infect and block the flea vector. Identification of such transmission factors allows further studies into the molecular mechanisms of the bacterial infection of the flea vector. Detailed understanding of the interaction with the insect host may lead to novel strategies to interrupt the transmission cycle. Our studies of flea vector competence and vectorial capacity will be useful to develop more realistic mathematical modeling of the epidemiology of plague transmission and the conditions that lead to plague epizootics.     During FY2016, we published  a study on the vector competence of the cat flea Ctenocephalides felis. C. felis is generally considered to be a poor vector, but the reasons for its relative inefficiency were unknown. Our data demonstrate that when infected cat fleas are restricted to a feeding pattern typical of X. cheopis, Y. pestis can survive, multiply, and block the digestive tract.  However, cat fleas will feed much more frequently if given the opportunity, and this feeding pattern significantly decreased vector competence in our experiments. Variation in foregut anatomical features and physiology, in addition to frequency and duration of feeding, may partially explain differences in vector competence between flea species. C. felis is a common domestic and peridomestic flea in parts of Africa and China where plague is endemic.  Since it feeds on a variety of hosts, including humans and wild rodent reservoirs of Y. pestis, it has been considered as a vector that could be responsible for transmitting Y. pestis to humans.  Our work suggests that the most likely scenario for C. felis to become infective would be after its host dies of septicemic plague and their normal feeding schedule is disrupted, giving Y. pestis an opportunity to establish a transmissible infection. Thus, feeding behavior, differences in host preference, and foregut anatomy, rather than an intrinsic resistance to infection, likely limits transmission of Y. pestis by the cat flea.   In collaboration with the Genomics Unit of the RML Research Technologies Branch, we are examining and characterizing the transcriptomes of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and our biofilm-producing Y. pseudotuberculosis mutant during growth in vitro and during infection of the flea, with the goal of identifying genes and gene regulatory pathways that are important for flea-borne transmission. The in vivo and in vitro transcriptomic comparisons between these three strains are designed to broadly identify candidate components of biofilm regulatory pathways and other genes important for the recent evolutionary adaptation to flea-borne transmission. Significant differences in the expression of orthologous genes in the flea might be indicative of evolutionary changes in gene regulatory pathways.  These results will be published in FY2017. We developed a new model system incorporating standardized experimental conditions and viability controls to more reliably compare the infection and transmission dynamics of different flea vectors.  We used this system to compare the relative efficiency of transmission by Xenopsylla cheopis, a rat flea known to be an efficient plague vector, and Oropsylla montana, a North American ground squirrel flea that has been considered to be a poor vector. We found that both X. cheopis and O. montana transmit Y. pestis equivalently, resolving a long-standing uncertainty concerning the vector competence of O. montana.  These results will be published in FY2017.We developed and evaluated new experimental systems to maintain and monitor infection status and transmission efficiency of individual fleas at different times after infection.  The data will be used to estimate values for important parameters such as the probability of flea vectors developing a transmissible infection after feeding on a bacteremic host and the transmission efficiency during a four-week period after infection.  Limited data are available are currently available for these values, which are needed for understanding plague epidemiology.  We will use these values in mathematical models to better understand conditions that give rise to periodic plague epizootics.',\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatotropic virus that replicates by reverse transcription. It chronically infects ~350 million people and kills >600,000 annually. Therapy primarily employs nucleos (t)ide analogs that drive HBV to below the limit of detection in most patients. However, viral replication is not eradicated and viral replication resurges if drug is withdrawn, so therapy is life-long. Nevertheless, current treatment does clear HBV in some patients, so more patients could be cured by suppressing HBV further. Greater suppression of HBV will require new drugs that will probably be used in combination with the nucleos (t)ide analogs.  HBV reverse transcription requires a viral DNA polymerase to synthesize new DNA and a viral ribonuclease H (RNaseH) to destroy the RNA after its conversion into DNA. Blocking either activity prevents HBV replication. Drugs against the RNaseH do not exist due to an inability to produce enzyme suitable for screening. We recently produced HBV RNaseH suitable for drug discovery. We screened 54 troponoid compounds, focusing on the α-hydroxytropolones (αHTs), based on their ability to inhibit the HIV RNaseH and β-thujaplicinol's inhibition of the HBV RNaseH. Thirteen compounds inhibited the HBV RNaseH, and the best had an IC50 value of 2.3 µM. six compounds suppressed HBV replication in culture via blocking viral RNaseH activity. The best compound had an EC50 of 0.34 µM and a therapeutic index of 94. A preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) was derived that provides guidance for optimization by medicinal chemistry.  Here, Dr. Tavis (virologist) and Drs. Murelli and Meyers (synthetic and medicinal chemists) will collaborate to begin development of the αHTs into potent anti-HBV drugs.  Aim 1. Produce optimal αHT inhibitors of HBV replication. We will synthesize ~320 αHTs based on our preliminary SAR. These compounds will be tested in an iterative fashion for anti-HBV RNaseH activity in biochemical, viral replication, and cytotoxicity assays.  Aim 2. Optimize cytotoxicity, ADME, PK, and efficacy parameters in a mouse model of HBV replication. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME), initial pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicity will be measured to guide compound design. Efficacy will be characterized in a mouse model of HBV replication for the leading inhibitors.  Aim 3. Evaluate the potential for use of αHT compounds in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogs. We will assess efficacy of the optimized αHT compounds against common nucleos(t)ide analog- resistant HBV strains. We will also evaluate whether αHT inhibitors work synergistically with the nucleos(t)ide analogs as predicted from their binding to physically distinct active sites on the HBV reverse transcriptase.  This project will produce the first αHT inhibitors designed against the HBV RNaseH and will define their potential to contribute to anti-HBV therapy. It may also produce lead compounds for drug development.\",\n",
       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of bronchiolitis in infants worldwide; and humanepidemiological studies have identified age at initial RSV infection as an independent risk factor for thedevelopment of childhood asthma. Our laboratory, and others, have used neonatal (i.e. ≤7d of age) mousemodels of infection to more closely mimic the interaction between RSV and the human infant immune system.With these models, we demonstrated significant differences in the immune response to RSV of neonatescompared to adults. For example, neonatal mice mount a Th2-biased response to RSV infection as do humaninfants. Reinfection of mice initially infected as neonates induces airway inflammation characterized byneutrophils and eosinophils, mucus hyperproduction, and airways hyperreactivity, all symptoms of severehuman RSV disease. We previously found that much of these age-dependent responses were mediated byincreased levels of IL4Rα on neonatal myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and Th2 cells and by early signaling byIL13. Here, our preliminary data demonstrate that this early IL13 is induced as a result of increased type IIinnate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and the increase in ILC2s is driven by rapidly elevated levels of IL33 in theneonatal RSV-infected lung. This is correlated with defective IL1β production in RSV-infected neonates, whichwe believe to be responsible for elevated IL33 (i.e. lack of negative regulation of IL33 by IL1β and/or caspase 1in airway epithelial cells). Although IL33 has been studied extensively in other disease states, no study hasinvestigated the role of IL33 in RSV pathogenesis in a neonatal/infant immune system. Our findings lead to ourcurrent, novel hypothesis that inchoate IL1β production by neonatal AECs during RSV infection results inexcessive pulmonary IL33 that activates DCs promoting Th2-biased immunopathogenesis. We willexplore the validity of this hypothesis using unique sample sets from human infant RSV infection cohorts andage-relevant mouse models through the following specific aims. Aim 1 will demonstrate that neonatalprogenitor airway epithelial cells (AECs) orchestrate RSV immunopathogenesis via IL33. We will alsodemonstrate that IL33 is predictive of RSV disease severity in infants. Aim 2 will determine if age-relateddifferences in IL1β responses by AECs are responsible for increased IL33 levels and the production of moreactive forms of IL33 in response to neonatal RSV using innovative methodologies for targeted quantitativeinvestigation of IL33 form variants. Aim 3 will identify mechanisms whereby IL33 directly activates pulmonaryDCs to prime naïve CD4+ T cells to induce Th2-biased responses. The concept of age-dependent regulation ofIL33 presented here is novel and will provide molecular mechanisms responsible for the human infant immuneresponse to RSV. In addition, the data derived from these studies are expected to have a positive paradigm-shifting impact in understanding severe RSV disease and should yield novel immunological targets to advancepediatric vaccine design.',\n",
       " 'This research will examine the epidemiological implications and evolution of multiple modes of disease transmission. Using simulation and theoretical analysis, general strategic models describing vector and aerial transmission in spatially extended populations will be developed concurrently with models applicable to anther-smut disease, a model system for studies of disease ecology in natural populations. Adaptive dynamics theory will be used to investigate how transmission mode evolves in response to different life history and epidemiological features. To apply that theory to a real-world system, this research will measure contributions of aerial and vector transmission in nature, study genetic variation and covariation in transmission mode in host populations, and look for the signals of transmission mode in natural populations where there is long-standing data on density and disease prevalence. This disease system is well characterized ecologically and genetically, and is a highly tractable model system allowing large and directed experimental studies of transmission modes in natural populations. A key advance is the formulation of transmission functions to take into account host spatial distributions, including the concept of a perception kernel to study vector transmission. Furthermore, the work breaks new ground by investigating the evolution of transmission mode itself, rather than the evolutionary consequences of transmission mode for other host and pathogen traits such as virulence. This study emphasizes that the evolution of transmission mode is a co-evolutionary process involving the interplay of both host and pathogen traits, as well as the biotic and abiotic environmental context.',\n",
       " 'Studies on asexual stage immunity to P. falciparum 1.) Evaluate the merozoite antigen PfRH5 as a vaccine candidate. Our collaborators at Oxford University (Dr. Simon Draper et al.) are pursuing this protein as a vaccine candidate and, as a prelude to that, have conducted an immunization-challenge trial in Aotus monkeys. We have collaborated on evaluating growth inhibition activity (GIA) in sera from the monkeys and these results have now been published; the promising results have supported a human clinical trial of PfRH5 which has recently been completed; we have analyzed results from this trial and a manuscript reporting on this is in preparation. In addition, we are preparing for another clinical trial of PfRH5 which will be initiated later this year.2.) Investigate other targets of merozoite immunity - AMA1While AMA1 is a prominent vaccine candidate, it has two issues:1) antigenic polymorphism so that antibody responses tend to be strain-specific and 2) insufficient antibody production to result in protective immunity in humans. Our data supports the use of a mixture of 4-5 different AMA1 alleles to overcome the polymorphism. Further, we have collaborated with LMVR investigators (Dr. Louis Miller) to show that using AMA1 in conjunction with its partner protein RON2 produces antibodies with greater activity in the GIA assay. This complex is required for triggering junction formation between the merozoite and the red cell surface. Evaluation of this combination in an immunization-challenge trial in a non-human primate (Aotus) has been conducted and the results have been submitted for publication by Dr. Miller, supporting a human clinical trial.In addition, we have contributed to a clinical trial of AMA1 in the UK. This trial showed that, even though high levels of antibody were elicited and those antibodies showed GIA activity, they did not affect the rate of parasite growth in the parasite-challenged vaccine recipients. Thus much more has to be done to achieve partial protection in humans with this vaccine.3.) Studies of immunity to malaria in Kenieroba, Mali. Our 4-year investigation of the acquisition of immunity to malaria in Malian children represents perhaps the most detailed longitudinal study of malaria in African children that has been conducted and the results have now been published. More recently we collaborated with others to broaden the scope of anti-parasite functional activities and have added the neutrophil-dependent antibody-dependent respiratory burst assay. A manuscript on this technique has been published.4.) We continue to work with Drs. Amy Bei and Dyann Wirth (Harvard University), who are studying changes in frequency of different P.falciparum clones over time in Senegal. We have worked with them to examine the influence of human immune responses on the changes in clonal parasite patterns, particularly related to the observation of parasites with common genetic signatures. The first results of these studies using GIA and the variant surface antigen assay were published and an expanded study has recently been completed and a manuscript submitted.Studies on parasite sexual stages and malaria transmission:1.) Develop quantitative methodology for analysis of the standard mosquito membrane feeding assay (SMFA) to evaluate transmission blocking activity. The gold standard assay to evaluate the ability of antibodies to block transmission to mosquitoes is the SMFA, and we have performed an in depth study of this assay to define its characteristics in order to have confidence in assessing potential transmission blocking vaccine (TBV) candidates. We have shown that the SMFA is quite reproducible at high concentrations of antibody but highly variable at low concentrations, and we have worked with the Biostatistics group at NIAID to develop a mathematical model of the assay. Recently we have tested a modified model of the assay to show for the first time that we can predict the impact of a specific antibody on the reduction of P. falciparum parasite prevalence in mosquitoes based on the reduction in oocysts in an SMFA and the number of oocysts in control mosquitoes. Reduction in malaria prevalence in mosquitoes by an antibody is key to reducing transmission in the field. These results have recently been published and a detailed mathematical treatment of this work by our statistical colleagues is in press.2.) Search for and evaluate new possible transmission blocking vaccine candidates. Using SMFA we have evaluated a number of potential transmission blocking vaccine candidates. In collaboration with colleagues at Oxford University we have produced and tested a number of known and unknown sexual stage proteins from P. falciparum. Sera from immunized mice have been evaluated by SMFA but none have shown high levels of oocyst inhibition. Further we have tested antibodies produced by collaborators to a number of other sexual stage and mosquito vaccine candidates to compare their activity.3.) Assess the presence of asexual and sexual stage parasites in residents of Kenieroba, Mali throughout the year. In the spring of 2013 we initiated a new study (NIH 13-I-N107) to address the limited information on transmission in malaria endemic areas, and in 2014 we completed the field aspect of this study. Volunteers representing all age groups were finger pricked twice per month for 1 year to collect DNA and RNA. During the 2014-2016 time frame we completed analysis of over 10,000 samples of parasite DNA on filter paper. In November, 2013 (wet season), P. falciparum prevalence in the cohort was 37.0%, and in May of 2014 (dry season), the prevalence dropped to 10.0%. We also analyzed the longitudinal prevalence of the cohort; we observed that the 9-16 years old age group had the highest median longitudinal prevalence compared to the other age groups, and males had a higher median than females (22.0%). 4.)We showed for the first time that increasing P.falciparum longitudinal prevalence throughout the year was associated with decreasing risk of clinical malaria. This suggests that those with persistent parasite carriage acquire stronger protective immunity against clinical malaria.5.) We added a new barcoding procedure this year based on a methodology developed at Harvard University to determine how many different clones of parasites an individual was carrying. This allowed us to show that at least 70% of infections were polygenomic, so that most people in the population are carrying more than one parasite clone at any given time. 6.) Using the RNA collections from the same study, we used a qRT-PCR procedure to identify Pfs25 mRNA specific for gametocytes. In 2015-2016 we completed RNA analysis to determine who is carrying gametocytes. Interestingly, even though you might not see them on microscopy, more than 80% of people with parasites also have detectable gametocytes by molecular criteria. This shows that no one group can be uniquely targeted for interventions to reduce transmission.7.) With support from PATH/MVI, we have begun to evaluate humanized monoclonal antibodies to 3 different sexual/mosquito stage antigens.8.) We have initiated studies to examine the differentiation pattern of P. falciparum gametocytes in culture for 3 weeks using RNASeq techniques. We have obtained data on RNA transcription during differentiation and we are analyzing the data to identify better markers of early and late stage gametocyte development. In addition, we are conducting a series of experiments to determine what factors are necessary for successful differentiation of gametocytes so that robust numbers of oocysts can be obtained after mosquito infection.',\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   Phosphosignaling controls Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) physiology and pathogenesis on every level. In addition to two-component systems that phosphorylate protein on His and Asp, Mtb also produces eleven Ser/Thr kinases (STPKs). These STPKs are central for bacterial adaptations, and two Mtb STPKs, PknA and PknB, are essential for growth and under development as drug targets. The eleven STPKs were identified in the 1998 Mtb genome sequence, and no new STPKs have been described since. In a functional proteomics screen of Mtb ATPases, we identified >80 hypothetical proteins as novel, previously unrecognized ATPases. Further characterization showed remote structural homology of one of the hypotheticals, Rv0647c, with non- typical STPKs. Given the ATPase activity of Rv0647c, we tested for STPK activity and found that Rv0647c is a novel, highly divergent STPK. Importantly, Rv0647c is predicted to be essential, suggesting that Rv0647c has central functions relating to Mtb growth. Here, we will test the hypothesis that Rv0647c is a growth regulator kinase in Mtb by testing Rv0647c's essentiality, identifying cellular substrates, and by solving the Rv0647c crystal structure. Together, this project identifies a new component of the Mtb phosphosignaling network and provides the basis for targeting this member of a highly druggable enzyme family.\",\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in childrenand infants, affecting an estimated 64 million people and causing up to 250,000 deaths worldwide per year(WHO). In the US, ~60,000 young children and ~175,000 adults are hospitalized annually due to RSVinfection. High-risk adults (the elderly and patients with chronic heart or lung disease) experience the highestRSV-attributed mortality in the US (~14,000 deaths/year), commensurate with the mortality rates of seasonalinfluenza. RSV costs the US healthcare system billions of dollars annually. No vaccines or safe and effective therapeutics for RSV are available, although several products are inclinical trials. Currently, RSV treatment is mostly limited to supportive care, however, for the most acute casesin children, ribavirin, a broad-range antiviral with questionable RSV efficacy and significant safety issues, canbe used. Use of Synagis (palivizumab), a monoclonal antibody that inhibits RSV infection in the lowerrespiratory tract, is limited to the highest-risk children. Furthermore, Synagis is very expensive ($8,000 –$16,000 for a standard course of therapy for a premature infant), and it only reduces RSV-relatedhospitalizations by 55%. There is an urgent need for new and more cost-effective anti-RSV prophylactics andtherapies that can be applied to both children and adults. During Phase I of this award, Navigen employed an innovative strategy to identify a novel, protease-resistant D-peptide drug lead, CR32T, which targets the RSV entry machinery. Our drug discovery platformemploys an enantiomeric screening technology (mirror-image phage display) coupled with protein design, toidentify D-peptides that bind to a conserved and functionally critical site on the virus's F (fusion) protein.CR32T binds F with pM affinity and prevents it from completing a conformational change required for RSV toenter permissive cells. As such, it is a potent inhibitor of RSV in vitro. We have successfully validated this platform technology by identifying promising inhibitors for severalviruses that share a conserved entry mechanism. Our analogous anti-HIV D-peptide, CPT31, inhibits all majorcirculating HIV-1 strains, possesses an extremely high barrier to resistance, and has minimal immunogenicity.CPT31 has demonstrated great potential in preclinical testing, including initial safety and efficacy studies inrodents and non-human primates. Our experience with CPT31 will facilitate rapid advancement of CR32T. In this three-year Phase II application, we will determine the breadth of CR32T against multiple primaryRSV isolates (A and B strains), determine its potency in a gold standard animal model of RSV infection usingboth preventative and therapeutic dosing regimens, and complete IND-enabling studies. Our ultimate goal is toadvance this promising drug candidate to the clinic where it will have a significant worldwide impact as a safeand effective preventative and therapeutic for RSV infection in children and adults.\",\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Healthcare associated infections (HAI) are common in nursing homes and are often caused by multidrug- resistant organisms (MDRO) such as MRSA and antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacteria (R-GNB). These MDROs colonize residents and can be spread from resident to resident by healthcare personnel. The use of gowns and gloves can prevent this spread decreasing the risk of HAI; however, their use detracts from a home-like environment which is an important priority for nursing homes. The evidence for when to wear gowns and gloves in nursing homes and with which residents is lacking. In order to inform infection control practices in this setting, we recently completed an AHRQ funded project (1R18HS019979-01A1) to study MRSA transmission to gowns and gloves worn by healthcare personnel interacting with nursing home residents. Over 400 residents from 13 community-based nursing homes in Maryland and Michigan were enrolled. Cultures were obtained from each resident's anterior nares and perianal skin. We then asked healthcare personnel to wear gowns and gloves during usual care visits (e.g. bathing). A research coordinator observed and recorded the types of care delivered. At the end of each visit, the research coordinator swabbed the healthcare personnel's gown and gloves prior to disposing of them. From 401 enrolled residents, we identified 113 residents colonized with MRSA. We found high rates of MRSA contamination on both gowns (14%) and gloves (24%). Importantly there were specific types of care and specific resident characteristics with a high risk of MRSA transmission. These results suggest several novel, evidence-based approaches to the use of gowns and gloves to reduce MRSA transmission. Determining whether the transmission of R-GNB is similar or different to the transmission of MRSA is key to deciding on the best of these approaches. The aim of this application is to estimate the overall and care- activity specific transmission risk for R-GNB using this unique existing collection of specimens. We will use culture based methods to detect R-GNB from our previously collected perianal swabs. Our preliminary data suggests that R-GNB transmission is lower than MRSA. We will test the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: Risk of R-GNB transmission to gowns and gloves is lower than the risk of MRSA transmission to gowns and gloves. Hypothesis 2: Risk of R-GNB transmission varies by type of contact with the resident. Some activities such as those involving care at high risk for MRSA transmission (e.g. bathing) are of higher risk than those not involving care at low risk for MRSA transmission (e.g. medications). This study will extend the findings on MRSA transmission to R-GNB providing further evidence for determining the optimal use of gowns and gloves to prevent the transmission of MDROs in community-based nursing homes.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our laboratory is to better understand the age-based differences in host immunity that affect acute and chronic pulmonary disease outcomes so we can improve therapeutic and vaccine strategies for infant and elderly populations. Our current research focus is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an infection that causes severe disease in the very old and very young, has no available vaccine and no effective therapy. We have developed an infant mouse model of RSV infection to improve our understanding of infant versus adult host immune responses to RSV infection. It is known is that the accumulation of cellular debris and airway occlusion is a consequence of severe RSV disease and alveolar macrophages (AMs), which make up >90% of airway cells, are responsible for clearing cell debris. However, little is known about how immature infant AMs contribute to severe disease or their potential for immunomodulation to mitigate RSV pathology. The goal of the proposed work is to determine the extent to which infant AMs prolong RSV replication and impair removal of apoptotic cells during infection and if immune modulation with inhaled IFNγ mitigates these effects. We have shown that treatment with inhaled IFNγ increases AM activation, expedites RSV clearance, and reduces the number apoptotic cells and mucus in infant BALB/c mice. We hypothesize that infant AMs contribute to the accumulation of apoptotic cellular debris and prolong RSV replication due to an immature lung environment which can be mitigated with inhaled IFNγ. To test our hypothesis we will complete two Specific Aims. The first Aim is to determine the mechanisms by which inhaled IFNγ enhances the clearance of RSV, apoptotic cells (ACs), and mucus and protects against RSV-mediated airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in neonatal mice. Results of this aim are expected to show that mice with depleted AMs will have reduced M1 and M2c AM function which is required for clearance of ACs, delayed RSV clearance, and increased airway resistance and that IFNγ acts on AMs to resolve these effects. Specific Aim 2 will define the signals that regulate the efferocytosis of RSV-laden A549 cells by human cord and adult blood monocyte-derived macrophages with or without IFN¿ priming. We expect IL-10/M-CSF polarized M2c macrophages, regardless of source, will increase AC clearance more than TGFß-polarized macrophages during RSV infection, but in the absence of T-cell recruitment, inhaled IFNγ will mitigate RSV-mediated impaired efferocytosis.',\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Beginning with John Snow's investigations of cholera epidemics, understanding and preventing infectious disease transmission has been one of the fundamental goals of epidemiology. Whole-genome sequences from viruses and bacteria are a promising new source of information about disease transmission, but current statistical methods are unable to incorporate these data into the analysis of transmission in households and other close-contact groups. The long-term goal is to develop statistical and epidemiologic methods that use high-resolution transmission data and genetic sequence data to inform rapid and effective public health responses to emerging infections. The goal of the proposed research is to develop ﬂexible and robust regression models for infectious disease transmission data that can incorporate pathogen genetic sequences. These will be based on a recently-developed semiparametric regression model that can estimate parameters crucial to mathematical models of epidemics and the design of interventions, including hazard ratios for covariate effects on infectiousness and susceptibility and baseline hazards of transmission in infectious-susceptible pairs. To make it a more practical tool for infectious disease epidemiology, this model will be extended to account for external sources of infection, missing data, and small samples. The partial likelihood for this model is a sum over the set of transmission trees consistent with the epidemiologic data on person, place, and time. Since a phylogeny linking pathogen samples from infected individuals constrains the set of possible transmission trees, pathogen genetic sequence data can be combined with epidemiologic data to obtain more efﬁcient estimates of transmission parameters. Epidemiologic and genetic data will be combined by developing algorithms to ﬁnd the set of transmission trees simultaneously consistent with both. These algorithms will be incorporated into Markov chain Monte Carlo or sequential Monte Carlo estimation procedures that will account for missing data and phylogenetic uncertainty. These methods will serve as a theoretical basis for the development of efﬁcient case-control and case-cohort study designs for outbreak investigations and vaccine trials. The proposed research is innovative because it synthesizes survival analysis and statistical genetics to analyze infectious disease transmission data. It is signiﬁcant because it will improve the collection and analysis o data and the evaluation of interventions in epidemics, allowing more effective control of emerging infections.\",\n",
       " 'Project 3: Attenuating RSV with Mutations in Its Methyltransferase PI: Jianrong Li, DVM, PhD Abstract: Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading causative agent of pediatric respiratory tract disease worldwide. Despite major efforts, there is no vaccine currently available to combat this virus. Live attenuated vaccines are the most promising vaccine candidates for RSV. However, it has been a challenge to identify an attenuated RSV strain that has an optimal balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. The objectives of this project are to rationally attenuate RSV by targeting the viral mRNA cap methyltransferase (MTase) and to develop MTase-defective viruses as novel live attenuated vaccine candidates for RSV. The RSV mRNA cap structure is methylated at the guanine-N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2’-O positions by a single conserved region VI (CR-VI) located in the large (L) polymerase protein. Amino acid residues essential for G-N-7 and/or 2’-O MTase activities will be characterized and will be introduced into an infectious cDNA clone of RSV. Recombinant RSVs defective in G-N-7 and/or 2’-O MTase activities will be recovered, and their attenuation in cell culture will be characterized. These recombinant viruses will be tested for their infectivity and ability to spread in primary, well differentiated, human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures. Next, their replication, pathogenesis, immunogenicity, and capacity to induce protection will be examined in cotton rats, the best available small animal model for RSV. By adding interferon-producing NS1 mutations (Project 1) and ‘repaired G’ mutations (Project 2) to the most promising MTase mutations in L to RSV, we expect that we will generate a panel of ideal RSV vaccine strains that grow well in Vero cells, are attenuated in vitro and in vivo, genetically stable, and highly immunogenic. These new, improved live RSV vaccine candidates can then be used for future trials in nonhuman primates.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rickettsia felis was originally identified in the United States as a human pathogen in 1991 and is now associated with human infection in North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Our ultimate goal for this research is to elucidate the biological and molecular mechanisms that are critical to rickettsial transmission by fleas in order to better understand the epidemiology of flea-borne rickettsial diseases and identify novel points of intervention. The results of the proposed studies will determine if R. fels utilizes multiple mechanisms for rapid horizontal transmission between fleas independent of a rickettsemic vertebrate host. This is a new paradigm for vector-borne rickettsial diseases. Also, the probability that a novel rickettsial response occurs in the arthropod host, and is somehow associated with rickettsial transmission, has long been a tenant of vector-borne rickettsial diseases; however, this has never been tested in an actual transmission system. The experimental focus of this application is to delineate horizontal transmission mechanisms through comparative analyses three distinct rickettsial strains in two different arthropod vectors,cat fleas and rat fleas. The rickettsial-derived molecules underlying the transmission of R. felis in flea hosts are not known. Studies will also employ rickettsial mutagenesis to identify transmission determinants in a flea transmission system. Two limiting factors for vector/disease management and the barriers to advancing the field are the scant knowledge of 1) basic transmission biology of R. felis and, 2) the rickettsial-derived determinants of transmission. Through completion of the specific aims outlined in this application, these studies will overcome the hurdles by assessing rickettsial transmission by fleas (Specific Aim 1) and through identification of Rickettsia-derived molecular constituents essential to transmission events (Specific Aim 2). Thus, this is a multifaceted approach to decipher the vector and pathogen-associated factors essential to transmission and will provide a platform to examine other flea-borne bacterial pathogens. Aim 1. Delineate the mechanism by which Rickettsia felis is acquired and transmitted by arthropods. Stable vertical transmission of certain vector-borne pathogens eliminates the need for a vertebrate host; however, unless this transmission event is 100% efficient, additional horizontal amplification is required for maintenance of the pathogen in the environment. We will test the hypothesis that if vertical transmission of R. felis by fleas is not 100%, then horizontal transmission of R. felis must occur between fleas. The objective of this aim is to identify novel routes of R. felis acquisition by fleas and assess the intra- and inter-specific transmission of R. felis. Aim 2. Define the Rickettsia-derived molecular constituents of transmission by flea vectors. Vector-borne bacterial pathogens undergo essential molecular transformation in the vector prior to transmission to the vertebrate host. We will test the hypothesis that if R. felis expresses a distinct rickettsial protein profile that orchestrates infetion of arthropods and subsequent transmission, then disruption of key molecules will impede infection and/or transmission. To test this hypothesis, we will focus on (a) targeted mutagenesis in R. felis and (b) analysis of isogenic rickettsial mutants in flea-infection and transmission.',\n",
       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the primary cause of respiratory infection in young children, causing >120,000 hospitalizations in the US annually. RSV vaccine development has been hampered by the history of a failed vaccine trial in the early 1960s in which vaccinated children were not protected against subsequent natural infection but rather experienced more severe disease. Subsequent experiments in animal models and human subjects suggest the occurrence of severe RSV disease correlates with the induction of virus-specific Th2 CD4 T cells and eosinophil recruitment and degranulation. The G glycoprotein of RSV and killed virus vaccines containing adjuvants such as alum induce these types of immune responses associated with the vaccine-enhanced disease syndrome.In these studies, we have examined the role of the both the antigen, FI-RSV, and immune response to this antigen as well RSV itself to gain insight into immunopathology and enhanced-disease. With our recent stablization of the RSV F protein in the prefusion confirmation, we have identified epitopes that are expressed only on the prefusion form of the F protein.  We have applied these findings to better understanding the conformation of the F protein in the FI-RSV vaccine and the specificity of the immune response generated towards the vaccine.  Additionally, we have examined the contribution of CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells to immunopathology and viral clearance.  CD4 T cells can influence and regulate the function of other immune effectors including CD8 T cells. In addition to the potential role of Th2 CD4 T cells in RSV pathogenesis as mentioned above, T regulatory cells have properties that suggest they may be important in RSV immunity and pathogenesis.  We are currently evaluating the recruitment of regulatory T cells during primary and secondary infections.',\n",
       " 'AbstractRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is among the leading causes of pediatric death secondary to pneumoniaworldwide. Although the molecular biology of RSV has been elucidated in detail, specific mechanisms ofpathogenesis remain poorly defined. Historically, the study of RSV, both in cell culture and animal models hasrelied on a relatively small number of laboratory strains, many of which have been passaged in culture for over50 years. We propose an innovative approach to the study of RSV pathogenesis that includes the use ofclinical isolates. Our hypothesis is that clinical isolates of RSV possess naturally occurring mutations(polymorphisms) that result in alteration in pathogenesis and virulence. Indeed, we have identified clinicalisolates of RSV that differ significantly in their ability to induce cytokines and the innate immune response inhuman macrophages. Specific aim 1 is to map these induction phenotypes on the viral genome. To do this, wehave created an infectious clone of RSV strain NH1125B, a high inducing strain, and have recoveredrecombinant virus. We will use this system to recover recombinant viruses in which regions of the NH1125Bgenome have been replaced with corresponding regions of the genome of NH1067B, a low inducing strain.Chimeric viruses will be screened for their ability to induce cytokine production and host innate immunity usingtranscriptome analyses. Specific Aim 2 is to define the innate immune responses in children infected with RSVand to determine whether the patterns of innate immune activation are associated with specific genotypes ofRSV. To do this, we will conduct a clinical study and enroll RSV-infected children < 1 year old with either milddisease (evaluated in the clinic or emergency department and discharged home) or severe disease (admittedto the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) with severe respiratory tract illness) and determine A) whether thegenetic elements identified in Specific Aim 1 are associated with severity of RSV disease. Here our hypothesisis that the viral polymorphisms defined in Specific Aim 1 will be unequally distributed between the virusesobtained from the children in each group. B) We will determine whether the transcriptome profiles of cellspresent in respiratory secretions of children with either mild or severe infection are distinct and whether thesetranscriptome patterns are associated with viral genotype. This will be accomplished by defining thetranscriptome, by RNA-SEQ technology, of host cells in respiratory secretions of RSV-infected children. Wehave developed a means to obtain nearly complete virus genome sequence from respiratory specimens usingRNA-SEQ. Using bioinformatics, we will determine whether viral genetic genotype are associated with hostgene expression. In all, the findings of these studies will shed light on the genetic elements of the RSV genomethat are associated with severity of disease and pathogenesis. Ultimately, the data obtained here will providenovel approaches to RSV vaccine and antiviral therapy.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Organ transplantation has become the modality for the treatment of end-stage organ failure. Chronic rejection remains a leading cause of graft loss in the long term. One of the primary reasons for this is that the adaptive immune system plays an integral role and is just emerging as a critical mediator in organ transplantation. Accumulating evidence indicates that the adaptive immune system is activated at the time of organ transplantation and remains in play longer than initially recognized by the release of inflammatory triggers, including oxidative stress. Various translational research efforts have identified pathways and potential therapeutics that may allay the effects of chronic rejection by conferring an enhanced inflammation resolution and a tolerogenic phenotype in allograft recipients. Polyphenols, such as resveratrol (RSV), reduce a range of pathologies associated with organ transplantation, including inflammation. The activities of these compounds are achieved via various mechanisms including their well-characterized antioxidant effects and immunosuppression effects. The clinical use of RSV is not; however, mainstream as issues regarding poor selectivity, dosage, toxicity and delivery methods are unresolved. Here, we propose a novel delivery method wherein an immunotherapeutic is encapsulated in a biologically inert nanoparticle and delivered in a targeted manner to an allograft in vivo. To thisend, we have generated RSV analogs to improve bioavailability and toxicity of RSV. The encapsulation of RSV analogs in micelle nanoparticles and its impact on harvested organs requires proof-of-concept studies. We will engineer a micelle nanoparticle which is conjugated to the amino acid sequence of Arg-Gly-Asp (cRGD), which serves as a targeting moiety directed towards the αvβ3 integrin on endothelial cells which optimizes cellular uptake. Near infrared fluorophores are also conjugated to the surface, allowing for analysis of micelle uptake and cellular localization within the endothelium of donor organ allografts. We hypothesize that targeted local delivery of packaged RSV via cold storage perfusion will increase concentrations of RSV intracellular and preserve aortic allograft cytoarchitecture.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cholera has become endemic in multiple sites around the globe and can cause devastating local epidemics, such as Zimbabwe in 2008-2009 and Haiti in 2010-2012. In the last 50 years, the scientiﬁc understanding of cholera transmission hasemphasized infection from the environment. Recently, evidence has accumulated that person-to-person transmission may play an important role in endemic and epidemic cholera. Vibrio cholerae strains sampled from humans often do not match well with strains sampled from the environment, and Vibrio cholerae excreted from human patients is in a transient hyperinfective state with an infectious dose 10-100 times lower than that not recently passed through humans. An emerging hypothesis is that environmental reservoirs and  slow  human-environment-human transmission pathways maintain cholera reservoirs and spark epidemics but  fast  human-to-human transmission drives the explosive growth of epidemics. If true, this hypothesis would justify increased emphasis on interventions targeted to households or other close contact groups of cholera cases for the control of endemic and epidemic cholera. Despite its potential importance to public health, much of the evidence for this hypothesis is circumstantial. The long-term goal is to test this hypothesis and to understand its implications for cholera control and study design. The goal of the proposed research is to re-analyze longitudinal cholera incidence data from the households of index cases using semiparametric regression models for infectious disease transmission. These models allow the estimation of hazard ratios for infectiousness and susceptibility without making parametric assumptions about the time course of infectiousness in infected individuals. Compared to previous statistical methods for the analysis of household transmission data, these models are more robust, more ﬂexible, and more numerically stable. These methods also have the potential to incorporate pathogen genetic sequence data, which is being collected in several ongoing cholera studies and may allow more precise estimation of transmission parameters. This research is innovative because it applies novel statistical methods to test an important hypothesis in public health. It is signiﬁcant because understanding the role of person-to-person transmission will be crucial to the effective control of endemic and epidemic cholera.',\n",
       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and small children. RSV infection in mice is characterized by significant immunopathology which is mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Past studies have suggested that CD8+ T cells with different functional properties and characteristics can be elicited following infection or immunization, and may have differential effects on viral clearance and RSV-associated illness. We have described differences between neonatal and adult CD8+ T cell responses elicited during RSV infection. Differences in clonotype, functional avidity, and other intrinsic parameters of the CD8+ T cell response may help dictate the epitope hierarchy established following infection. We have now defined the dynamics of lung-migratory dendritic cell populations in the lung and lung-draining lymph nodes of RSV-infected mice during early life as compared to adulthood and have determined lung dendritic cell populations that induce RSV-specific adaptive T cell responses following infection. These dendritic cells were found to induce T cell responses in an age-dependent manner, and we have implicated lower costimulatory molecule expression by neonatal dendritic cells as one mechanism for this difference. Our work in the last year has been greatly aided by continuing characterization of three strains of transgenic mice with CD8+ T cells specific for RSV and we have characterized the response to RSV infection of two T cell clones in mice in vivo.   We have recently generated CD4+ T cell transgenic mice and aim to characterize these T cell population as well.  Importantly, we have demonstrated that intranasal vaccination with MCMV vectors expressing RSV antigens promotes tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells which protect against RSV challenge. Finally, we have collaborated with a group at Leiden Institute of Chemistry to investigate mechanisms of controlling CD8+ T cell recognition using chemical methods.  These types of approaches can be useful for controlling the induction and function of CD8+ T cells.  Continued work on this study will fully characterize CD8+ T responses to RSV, elucidate important factors that dictate the type of CD8+ T cell response that is generated, and help understand how other cell types regulate the CD8+ T cell response in an age-dependent fashion.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The very young and the elderly are particularly susceptible to respiratory infections induced by streptococcus, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) making these populations high priority targets for effective vaccines. Much of our understanding of immunity in the elderly has been acquired through studies on mice, which do not always translate to humans. Our incomplete knowledge of the fundamental immunology of aged human populations impedes our ability to design effective vaccines targeting this population. What would greatly enhance our current knowledge is an effective in vivo model for a g e d human immune responses that could be experimentally manipulated. A humanized mouse model has been developed in which the fully functionally mature B, T and dendritic cells found in null peripheral blood (PBL) are transferred into immunodeficient NOD.scid.IL2rgc (NSG) mice. Although immune reconstitution is immediate B cells are not maintained. Our laboratory has found providing PBL reconstituted NSG mice with the critical B cell growth and survival factor, B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), either by injection of recombinant protein or production from an AAV delivered huBLyS transgene, supports the survival and function of human B cells and allows robust responses to both T cell dependent and independent immunogens. In this submission we propose to extend our model to the study of the immune responses of elderly humans. We hypothesize that NSG mice reconstituted with PBL from elderly adults will retain the immune response characteristics of the individuals from which they where obtained. We have been able to elicit, in humanized mice prepared using the PBL from healthy young to middle aged donors, humoral immune responses to RSV and to RSV based virus-like particles (VLPs) that are isotype-switched, affinity matured and virus neutralizing and to produce a collection of human monoclonal antibodies specific for RSV-F and Ga envelope proteins.  RSV infection does not produce durable humoral immunity or B memory cells specific for RSV making development of an effective vaccine challenging. We posit age disparate immunologically humanized surrogates will allow us to model and define the cellular mechanisms that effect responses to pathogens and vaccines. Experimentally, we propose to use young and elderly humanized surrogates to compare and contrast immune responsiveness, immunoglobulin repertoire, and the induction of protective anti-RSV antibody as induced by either RSV infection or immunization with an RSV-VLP demonstrated to induce durable protective immunity in mice. The proposed studies should facilitate attempts to develop immunization strategies effective for the young and elderly.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) increase patient morbidity and mortality. CRE are emerging pathogens with a predilection for ICU patients. MRSA also is extremely prevalent, leading to a large number of patients in the United States being placed on contact precautions for MRSA. Contact precautions prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the acute-care setting. However, contact precautions may also have adverse effects, including a decreased frequency of healthcare worker visits, increased psychological symptoms of patients, and potentially more serious adverse events. What is not known is if certain patients are more likely to transmit antibiotic-resistant bacteria to healthcare workers and subsequent patients, and if so, what characteristics identify these patients. In addition, what is not known is which healthcare worker-patient interactions lead to greater transmission and which bacterial-specific factors lead to increased transmission. The overall objective of this proposal is to explore factor associated with transmission of these bacteria and potential biomarkers to help determine which patients with CRE and MRSA should be placed on contact precautions, which may need enhanced precautions, and which may not need contact precautions. The proposed research is feasible because we have experience and have published using all of the methodologies proposed. Our hypothesis is that certain patient characteristics and certain healthcare worker-patient interactions lead to higher transmission and that the individual risk factors identified wil be unique for CRE and MRSA. We plan to test our central hypothesis and, thereby, accomplish the objective of this application by pursuing the following three specific aims: Aims 1 and 2: We will perform a multi-site, diverse geographic region cohort study to determine which patient risk factors and healthcare worker-patient interactions lead to greater transmission of CRE (aim 1) and MRSA (aim 2). Aim 3: We will perform whole genome sequencing on stored specimens obtained in aims 1 and 2 for high- transmission bacteria and low-transmission bacteria to determine molecular properties of the bacteria that result in observed differences in transmission. The significance of the proposed work is that it will lead to greater understanding of the factors associated with transmission of these bacteria, identifying high risk activities andprovide biomarkers to help determine which patients with CRE and MRSA should be placed on contact precautions, which may need enhanced precautions, and which may not need contact precautions. This proposal is innovative for the following reasons: a) It explores the novel concept of  superspreaders  of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which has been suggested previously, but never studied in depth; b) The surrogate outcome of culturing healthcare workers hands and gloves upon room exit greatly increases the power of the study and is a near-perfect surrogate outcome for patient transmission; and c) This outcome choice allows the study to be done in a cost-effective manner on a smaller scale.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY More than 350 million people are chronically infected by Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and are at high risk fordeveloping cirrhosis and liver cancer. Current drugs do not cure HBV and do not target covalently closed-circular DNA (cccDNA), which has been linked to viral persistence in HBV-infected hepatocytes. Moreover,current therapies require lifetime treatment to suppress viral load and prolonged treatments lead to thedevelopment of drug resistant strains. Finally, there is only a single family of directly acting antiretrovirals(DAAs) that can block HBV infection, preventing meaningful combination therapies equivalent to formidablehighly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) that tipped the scales in the fight against AIDS. The long term goal of this work is to develop HBV therapies that lead to HBV eradication. It is hypothesizedthat combinations of novel, potent, and selective inhibitors of HBV can lead to more efficient suppression ofreverse transcription (RT), lack of cross-resistance, synergistic mechanism of action and depletion of cccDNA,which in turn could lead to the eradication of HBV. Towards that end, this project focuses on the developmentof leads that target viral replication by capsid assembly effectors (CAEs) and highly potent novel NRTIs. Thefollowing specific aims are proposed:Specific Aim 1: Characterize the potency determinants of novel highly active NRTIs.Specific Aim 2: Discovery and characterization of novel capsid assembly effectors (CAEs)Specific Aim 3: Characterization of novel NRTI and CAE combinations These studies will identify promising leads for the development of future anti-HBV drugs from two differentclasses and will help design novel combinations that should efficiently suppress cccDNA by targeting Cp andinclude highly potent HBV NRTIs towards a sustained virological response that could lead to HBV eradication.',\n",
       " 'Human parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3 (HPIV1, 2, 3) are significant causes of severe pediatric respiratory tract disease worldwide. The HPIVs are enveloped, non-segmented, negative strand RNA viruses of the family Paramyxoviridae. The broad outlines of their biology and molecular genetics have been defined in previous studies by this laboratory and others. The HPIV genome encodes a nucleoprotein N, phosphoprotein P, large polymerase protein L, internal matrix protein M, and fusion F and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase HN transmembrane surface glycoproteins. F and HN are the 2 viral neutralization antigens and the major protective antigens. In addition, the P gene encodes various accessory protein(s) from one or more additional ORFs that have been described in previous years.Presently, our immediate goal is to develop attenuated versions of HPIV1 and 3 that have been engineered to express the fusion F protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) from an added gene. RSV is the most important viral agent of severe pediatric respiratory tract disease, with a contribution to human disease comparable to or exceeding that of the HPIVs combined, and the RSV F protein is the major RSV neutralization and protective antigen. An HPIV vector expressing the RSV F protein would provide a bivalent vaccine against the respective HPIV and RSV.Compared to RSV strains, the HPIVs replicate more efficiently in cell culture and have much greater physical stability. They also form discrete particles compared to the large filaments of RSV, making them more amenable to filtration and other steps in manufacture. These attributes make HPIV vectors much easier to manufacture, distribute, and use compared to attenuated RSV strains. These advantages may be essential for extending RSV vaccines to resource-challenged countries. Furthermore, in experimental animals, boosting RSV responses to an earlier primary immunization with an attenuated RSV strain was more efficient using an HPIV/RSV vector as opposed to re-dosing with the attenuated RSV strain, since the latter is subject to greater restriction by prior RSV-specific immunity.We have been evaluating a number of parameters of vaccine vector design using, as proof of principle, an attenuated HPIV3 vaccine candidate called B/HPIV3. This virus consists of bovine PIV3 in which the F and HN genes have been replaced by those of HPIV3, yielding a chimeric virus that is attenuated in primates due to the bovine backbone and bears the neutralization and major protective F and HN antigens of HPIV3. Previously, the empty B/HPIV3 vector was evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial, and was shown to be well-tolerated in infants and young children (NIH study). Subsequently, B/HPIV3 expressing the unmodified RSV F protein (B/HPIV3-RSV-F) was evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial in infants and young children, and also was well-tolerated (MedImmune study). However, the construct was poorly immunogenic for RSV F, and analysis of nasal wash specimens of shed vaccine showed that 50% of specimens had evidence of loss of expression of RSV F. Therefore, we have been working to increase the immunogenicity and stability of the RSV F insert.We previously evaluated the effects of the position of insertion of the RSV F gene into the B/HPIV3 backbone, and found that the first (pre-N) and second (N-P) gene positions readily accommodated the RSV F insert. This resulted in greatly increased expression of RSV F protein compared to downstream locations (up to 69-fold increase) and greatly increased fusion. Surprisingly, this did not appear to interfere with vector replication in vitro or in hamsters.We also previously found that expression of the RSV F protein was further enhanced 5-fold by codon-optimization and by modifying the amino acid sequence to be identical to that of an early passage of the original clinical isolate. This conferred a hypo-fusogenic phenotype that presumably reflects the original clinical isolate, and suggests that this strain of RSV may have mutated during passage in vitro to acquire a hyper-fusogenic phenotype.We also evaluated a version of pre-fusion RSV F protein (called DS) that was stabilized by an added disulfide bond. In the hamster model, the DS form of RSV F induced increased quantity and quality of RSV-neutralizing serum antibodies and increased protection against wt RSV challenge, compared to native F. We defined high quality antibodies as those that neutralized RSV in vitro in the absence of added complement: remarkably, expression of unmodified F did not induce detectable high quality antibodies in hamsters, whereas pre-F induced a titer of 1:250.During the present report period, we further modified RSV F by replacing its cytoplasmic tail (CT) domain, or its CT plus transmembrane (TM) domains (TMCT), with its counterparts from BPIV3 F. This was done with and without the DS pre-F stabilization. This resulted in RSV F being packaged in the B/HPIV3 particle with an efficiency similar to that of RSV particles. Enhanced packaging was substantially attenuating in hamsters (10- to 100-fold) and rhesus monkeys (100- to 1000-fold). Nonetheless, TMCT-directed packaging substantially increased the titers of high quality serum RSV-neutralizing antibodies in hamsters and rhesus monkeys. In rhesus monkeys, the combination of packaging plus pre-F stabilization resulted in 8- and 30-fold increases of serum RSV-neutralizing titers in the presence and absence of added complement, respectively, compared to pre-F stabilization alone, despite the much-lower replication due to TMCT.The genetic stability of the RSV F insert in the B/HPIV3 vector was evaluated by a double-immunostaining assay designed to detect expression of both RSV F and vector proteins. Surprisingly, the stability of RSV F expression typically was very high and was not affected by enhanced expression, or pre-F stabilization, or packaging via TMCT. An occasional preparation was found to have some loss of expression of RSV F, but this could simply be discarded and replaced by a replicate preparation.These studies provided improved versions of the well-tolerated rB/HPIV3-RSV F vaccine candidate, ones that induce a superior serum RSV-neutralizing antibody response. An improved version can now be returned to clinical trials.As noted above, packaging the RSV F protein into the B/HPV3 vector increased its level of attenuation in rhesus monkeys 100- to 1000-fold, while providing increased quantity and quality of serum RSV-neutralizing antibodies. However, this reduction in replication is not needed for safety, since the B/HPIV3 vector already was satisfactorily attenuated on its own, and the further 100- to 1000-fold reduction in replication may unnecessarily reduce immunogenicity due to reduced antigen expression. Therefore, we also are inserting the TMCT version of RSV F into other backbones that are less restricted than B/HPIV3, and therefore should yield a construct that is not over-restricted for replication and therefore should be more immunogenic. This presently is being evaluated with HPIV3 and HPIV1 as vectors, with and without an added attenuating mutation.',\n",
       " 'Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a worldwide health problem. It is estimated that there are 200 to 500 million HBV chronic carriers in the world for whom, to date, there is no reliable treatment. HBV causes both acute and chronic liver disease and is responsible for an estimated one million deaths annually. Currently available therapies reduce viral loads but fail to resolve chronic HBV infections. Therefore, effective treatments for chronic HBV infection are urgently required. The major obstacle to the resolution of chronic HBV infections is the eradication or inactivation of nuclear HBV covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA which is the template for viral transcription. To this end, we have developed HNF1α-null HBV transgenic mice and liver-specific FoxA/HNF3-deficient HBV transgenic mice. HNF1α-null HBV transgenic mice synthesize nuclear HBV CCC DNA. Liver-specific FoxA/HNF3-deficient HBV transgenic mice are viable but lack detectable HBV transcription and replication (i.e. they are effectively “cured”) suggesting FoxA/HNF3 not only plays an important developmental role in the hepatocyte-specific transcription factor network governing the hepatic phenotype but is also essential for viral biosynthesis. The observation that FoxA/HNF3-deficient HBV transgenic mice display hyper-methylation of HBV genomic DNA suggests that FoxA/HNF3 is epigenetically governing HBV transcription by modulating viral chromatin structure in vivo and hence determines the level of viral biosynthesis. Defining the precise temporal requirements for FoxA/HNF3 expression associated with HBV transcription and replication will indicate the liver developmental stages when viral biosynthesis is susceptible to inhibition by FoxA/HNF3 deficiency. This will be achieved by modulating FoxA/HNF3 expression in the FoxA/HNF3-deficient HBV transgenic mouse model using the TET/OFF system. Using this system, the developmental control of HBV transcription, viral biosynthesis and HBV DNA methylation by FoxA/HNF3 expression will be established and correlated with the epigenetic histone marks and chromatin structure associated with the HBV genome. Finally, similar studies will be performed using the HNF1α-null FoxA/HNF3-deficient HBV transgenic mouse model of chronic viral infection so the developmental control of HBV transcription, viral biosynthesis, HBV DNA methylation, epigenetic histone marks and chromatin structure by FoxA/HNF3 expression associated with the HBV genome can be compared between the HBV transgene DNA and the nuclear HBV CCC DNA. Defining the nature of the changes and the molecular signals responsible for the loss of HBV biosynthesis due to FoxA/HNF3 deficiency may lead to the identification of cellular therapeutic targets that are amenable to the development of novel modalities to resolve rather than simply treat chronic HBV infection.',\n",
       " \"Abstract One of the stumbling blocks to development of a live-attenuated RSV vaccine is induction of long-lasting immunity, which does not occur even with wild-type RSV infection. Since induction of robust adaptive immunity responses requires a strong innate immune activation, the short-lived anti-RSV response may be due to viral inhibition of type I interferon (IFN) induction. Antagonism of IFN production is largely due to the RSV NS1 protein, which is not absolutely essential for virus replication in culture although deletion of NS1 results in decreased viral replication even in IFN-deficient cells such as Vero. This proposal will identify domains and/or specific residues of NS1 responsible for IFN antagonism by targeted mutagenesis. Mutants that ablate the IFN antagonist function without affecting protein stability will be inserted into recombinant RSV (rRSV) and tested for their capacity to replicate in Vero cells and induce IFN in A549 cells. NS1 mutant rRSV that induce high levels of IFN expression and replicate well in these cell lines will be tested for IFN antagonism and replication in human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures. Further, the NS1 mutant rRSV will be tested in cotton rats, which are the best small animal model for RSV infection to determine replication in vivo, pathogenicity, immunogenicity, and protection from WT challenge. The best candidate NS1 mutants will be combined with the `repaired' G gene (Project 2) and the best attenuating L methyltransferase (MTase) mutations (Project 3) to produce double and triple mutant viruses that replicate well in Vero cells, induce high levels of IFN, efficiently infect HAE culture, and are attenuated and protective in cotton rats. Although beyond the scope of this P01, these vaccine candidates will be tested in non-human primate trials in the future.\",\n",
       " 'AbstractRespiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a human pathogen that is the predominant cause of acute lowerrespiratory tract infection in children. In the United States, nearly all children are infected with RSV by the ageof three. RSV is a major cause of serious respiratory illness requiring hospitalization in children with symptomsranging from severe pneumonia and bronchiolitis to milder infections. Furthermore, the inflammationassociated with repeated RSV infections, especially in children, is associated with chronic lung-relatedpathology. Since infection by RSV does not elicit natural immunity to subsequent infections, significantmorbidity and mortality are also associated with RSV infection of the elderly. There is no current FDA licensedvaccine for RSV infection and the only approved prophylactic treatment is the RSV neutralizing mAb Synagis.Recently, other strongly neutralizing antibodies against RSV were identified directed against novel epitopes inthe RSV F-protein. Due to the limited prophylactic options there remains a critical need for the development ofa RSV vaccine that can specifically generate neutralizing antibody responses in a platform that is efficacious inboth children and the elderly. This vaccine ideally could be produced and purified in a cost effective andscalable manner, and that would the need for cold chain storage.We have developed a novel technology based on bacteriophage MS2 virus-like-particles (VLPs) that allow forthe immunogenic display of heterologous peptide epitopes. We have constructed MS2 VLPs to display high-complexity, random sequence peptide libraries, which can be subjected to affinity-selection on known RSVneutralizing antibodies. This enables the discovery of epitope mimics (linear, conformational or non-peptide)recognized by selecting antibodies, and to display those epitope mimics on the surface of highly immunogenicVLP particles. Immunization with the selected VLPs then elicits antibodies whose activities mimic those of theselecting antibody. This novel technology provides the means to find new vaccine candidates that focus theimmune response only on the most efficacious epitopes, which is critical in the case of RSV, where non-neutralizing antibodies have been shown to enhance disease. The objective of this proposal is to produceRSV VLP-based vaccine candidates displaying peptide epitope mimics of neutralizing RSV mAbs directed tothe pre-fusion form of F-protein. The immunogenicity of the candidates will be tested using ELISA and in vitroneutralization assays. Immunogenic VLPs will be analyzed for efficacy and safety using a highly relevantcotton rat model of RSV infection.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatotropic DNA virus that replicates by reverse transcription. It chronically infects up to 350 million people and kills>600,000 annually. Therapy primarily employs nucleos(t)ide analog drugs that drive HBV to near or below the clinical limit of detection. However, viral replication is not eliminated and virl replication resurges if drug is withdrawn. Greater suppression of HBV will require new drugs to be used in combination with the nucleos(t)ide analogs.  Reverse transcription requires two viral enzymatic activities encoded on separate domains of the viral polymerase protein. The reverse transcriptase synthesizes new DNA and the ribonuclease H (RNaseH) destroys the RNA after conversion into DNA. Blocking either activity prevents synthesis of the HBV genome. Drugs have not been designed against the RNaseH because enzyme suitable for drug screening could not be made. We recently produced recombinant HBV RNaseH suitable for drug discovery and structural studies, and found all 25 known inhibitors of the RNaseH. The inhibitors had IC50 values as low as 2.3 µM, EC50 values against viral replication as low as 0.34 µM, and therapeutic indexes as high as 94. This is an outstanding starting point for development of anti-RNaseH drugs. However, difficulties in expressing the RT and RNaseH domains have prevented structural analysis of either domain, although reliable computational models exist for the RT. The lack of structural information for the HBV RNaseH is a major barrier to drug development because it precludes structure-based design of RNaseH inhibitors. This collaborative R03 project between Dr. Tavis (virologist) and Dr. Korolev (structural biologist) seeks to remove this block. The R03 mechanism was chosen to provide key pilot data for a future structure-function analysis of the enzyme that would not be competitive without preliminary crystallization data.  Aim 1. Initiate structural evaluation of the HBV RNaseH domain. Enzymatically active variants of the HBV RNaseH will be systematically subjected to extensive crystallization trials. Initial efforts to solve the structure of the RNaseH will be determined usig the best crystals as time permits.  Aim 2. Integrate the HBV RNaseH structure with the RT domain model. Our predicted RNaseH structure and a published predicted model will be computationally combined with the accepted model of the RT domain to generate the first 2-domain model for the HBV polymerase.  This R03 project will begin deriving the first experimentally-determined structural information for any part of the multi-functional HBV polymerase protein. Combining the RNaseH domain structure with the existing validated models of the RT domain will yield the first view of the catalytic engine of HBV replication. This 2-domain model will be invaluable for both translational studies seeking to improve anti-HBV therapies, and also greatly advance our understanding of the HBV replication mechanism.',\n",
       " 'Despite knowledge of vertical transmission for multiple infectious diseases for at least three-quarters of a century, we do not know how vertical transmission impacts the basic reproductive number (R0) of classically vector-borne infections. In addition, multi-species diseases are likely to persist through both vertical and horizontal transmission, and not enough is known about their collective impact on R0. It has been demonstrated that vertical transmission maintains endemic canine VL within US hunting hounds. We use this unique cohort to measure the infective capacity of vertical transmission in VL. With understanding gained from this study, we will be able to interpret how vertical transmission and horizontal transmission impact R0 separately, and we will quantify their interactive effect on R0. The proposed research introduces new statistical and computational methods for improved estimation of R0. Specifically, we propose to develop flexible spatio-temporal statistical models within the Bayesian hierarchical framework to evaluate the interactions between disease-causing organisms, their vectors, and their hosts. This work is proposed to be developed in the VL setting, and is designed to specifically motivate improved intervention efforts in Brazil, but to have wider applicability for a more general understanding of how complex transmission processes impact the estimation of R0. Previous models of VL transmission dynamics have not accounted for canine vertical transmission or a human reservoir. Coinfection with two or more pathogens modifies host immunity to each. This has been presumed true for multiple infections, but disease transmissibility has not been modeled based on the observation of comorbidity and transmissibility. Our goal is to find ways to decrease VL R0 to <1.0. We hypothesize that an integrative statistical model allowing hierarchical consideration of transmission in canine and human hosts, and vertical plus vector transmission, is a transformative tool to understand the interplay of vertical and vector borne disease. Finally, we will determine how disease transmission is influenced by different environments and comorbidities and compare roles of key transmission dynamics on pathogen maintenance, e.g. alter R0.',\n",
       " 'Abstract PROJECT 1: Identifying Asthma-causing RSV Strains and Elucidating the Mechanisms of RSV- mediated Asthma Development Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection during infancy represents a common risk factor that is strongly and consistently associated with asthma. It also represents an asthma risk factor with the strongest body of evidence establishing a causal relationship. In the first funding cycle we have been the first group to ever sequence and identify RSV strains associated with significantly increased risk of recurrent wheezing outcomes, as well as differential immune response and airway microbial patterns. This proposal addresses the next logical series of questions: (1) are these RSV strains associated with later childhood asthma development, and (2) can we better understand the mechanisms of RSV-mediated asthma development by assessing the host response to these strains in vivo and in vitro? To test our hypotheses that there are RSV strains associated with enhanced risk of asthma development, and they act through eliciting differential acute response to infant infection, altering airway and immune development, and early life microbial patterns, we propose to extend longitudinal follow-up of the 1900 children enrolled in the established INSPIRE birth cohort who will be four at the end of the first U19 funding period. This will enable us to confirm if the RSV strains that we have identified to cause more severe infant morbidity and early wheezing outcomes are also associated with asthma, and the pathways through which these RSV strains cause asthma. We propose the following: (1) Identify RSV strains associated with asthma inception at ages 6 to 8 years; (2) Determine how RSV strains impact the host microbial environment during primary RSV infection; (3) Assess primary airway epithelial cell (AEC) response to asthma-causing RSV strains; (4) Determine RSV induced immune responses associated with asthma inception in the INSPIRE cohort. Ultimately this information may inform the design and development of a vaccine that prevents “asthmagenic” RSV strains from predisposing to asthma development. The leadership team has worked in this area for 15 years, have an in-place infrastructure, established collaborations and ongoing cohort with detailed phenotyping and rich biospecimen repository making us well positioned to successfully carry out this novel and impactful study.',\n",
       " 'AbstractThe long term objective of this application is to define the relationship between infant respiratory syncytial virus(RSV) infection and the host response that enables asthma inception. There is abundant evidence thatchildren who experience severe RSV bronchiolitis during infancy are at greater risk for developing asthma laterin childhood; however the viral and host determinants that lead to asthma development are not known. InProject 1, we propose to extend longitudinal follow-up of the INSPIRE (Infant Susceptibility to PulmonaryInfections and Asthma Following RSV Exposure) population based birth cohort of over 1,900 middleTennessee infants who will be age 4 years at the end of the first U19 funding period. This will enable us toconfirm if the RSV strains that we have identified to cause more severe infant morbidity and early wheezingoutcomes are also associated with asthma, and the pathways through which these RSV strains cause asthma.We propose the following: (1) Identify RSV strains associated with asthma inception at ages 6 to 8 years; (2)Determine how RSV strains impact the host microbial environment during primary RSV infection; (3) Assessprimary airway epithelial cell (AEC) response to asthma-causing RSV strains; (4) Determine RSV inducedimmune responses associated with asthma inception in the INSPIRE cohort. In the first funding cycle we havebeen the first group to ever sequence and identify RSV strains associated with significantly increased risk ofrecurrent wheezing outcomes, as well as differential immune response and airway microbial patterns. Wefound that infants infected with RSV strains that contained a mutation in the attachment (G) gene endsequence (2stop-A4G mutation) had statistically significantly increased bronchiolitis severity scores comparedto infants infected with the RSV WT genotype. Infection with 2stop-A4G mutation strains is becomingincreasingly more common in human infants and studies from our group reveal that strains containing the2stop-A4G mutation cause Th2 innate immune responses in mice and humans. In Project 2, we propose thefollowing in the mouse model of RSV infection: (1) determine the contribution of infection with RSV 2stop-A4Gto Th2 immunity in primary bronchiolitis, and (2) determine the contribution of 2stop-A4G to enhanced adaptiveimmune responses to inhaled aeroallergen. Defining the contribution of specific RSV strains to infantbronchiolitis and asthma pathogenesis highlights the clinical significance of our studies and may provide atherapeutic target for vaccines and precision medicine approaches that focus on RSV mutations.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection occurs in 60% of infants during the first year of life and 90% are infected one or more times by year 2, representing the greatest risk for hospitalization for infants, no vaccine or therapeutic treatment exists for this unmet medical need. The first clinically tested vaccine; a formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) preparation not only did not protect infants and young children but seriously enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) in a majority of children and resulted in 2 deaths. The complication of ERD has contributed to the failure to develop a RSV vaccine for the past 50 years. No killed or subunit vaccines have been tested in naïve infants since the 1960s and live-attenuated RSV vaccines have other attendant risks (i.e., insufficient attenuation for the immature pulmonary and immune systems of infants and reversion to wildtype). Our approach to this problem is to focus on producing an  epitope-based  vaccine that elicits the one anti-RSV specificity that is known to protect against severe disease and is known not to enhance disease. A monoclonal antibody (Mab) (palivizumab) specific for a site A domain on the fusion (F) protein neutralizes RSV and prophylactically acts against severe disease and is licensed to be prescribed for high risk infants. The palivizumab-specific antibody epitope has been well defined within a 24 residue site (F254-277). Our approach is to insert the F254-277 epitope onto a well characterized virus-like particle (VLP i.e. the WHcAg). In other words, we propose to elicit palivizumab-like neutralizing antibodies by active immunization as opposed to the expensive and laborious method of passive Mab transfer. This goal has proven to be challenging because the F254-277 epitope is conformational and the inserted epitope must approximate the antigenic structure that is present on the intact virus. However, we have succeeded in the design and production of several RSV-WHcAg VLPs that bind palivizumab, elicit high titer neutralizing antibodies and efficiently protect mice against RSV challenge. Our success may be partly attributable to the fact that the immunodominant portion of our VLP carrier has a helix-loop-helix structure similar to that of the F254-277 epitope. Our approach has been to use the Combinatorial Technology, developed for the WHcAg platform, to generate a library of 79 hybrid-VLPs displaying the F254-277 epitope to select several candidates. In this SBIR we will assess the feasibility of exploiting a panel of F254-277-displaying VLPs to produce an epitope- focused RSV vaccine with increased diversity for the palivizumab epitope. In a final pivotal experiment, we will perform a cotton rat immunization/RSV challenge study to assess the potential of this approach to overcome ERD.',\n",
       " 'RSV vaccine:The primary goal is to identify, in phase 1 pediatric clinical trials, a live-attenuated strain of RSV suitable for further development as a pediatric RSV vaccine, to be given by intranasal administration. We previously showed that deletion of the ORF encoding the small (90 amino acids) viral M2-2 protein results in down-regulated viral RNA replication (causing viral attenuation) and up-regulated viral gene transcription and antigen synthesis, raising the possibility of increased immunogenicity. We recently evaluated a prototype virus bearing this mutation, called RSV MEDI/delM2-2, in a phase 1 clinical trial with clinical collaborators at Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health (JHU; NCT01459198). In seronegative children, compared to our previous lead RSV vaccine candidate rA2cp248/404/1030delSH, the delM2-2- virus was significantly more restricted for shedding in nasal washes but induced significantly higher titers of RSV neutralizing serum antibodies. Thus, it indeed appeared to have increased immunogenicity per infectious unit. Surveillance during the subsequent RSV season provided presumptive evidence of protection and strong anamnestic antibody responses.In the present review period, we completed a phase 1 clinical trial of a second delM2-2-based candidate, called RSV LID/M2-2. This was performed in 29 seronegative children 6-24 months of age (20 vaccine recipients and 9 placebo controls; NCT02040831 and NCT02237209). This study was done in collaboration with JHU plus the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) network. Unexpectedly, this virus was substantially less restricted than MEDI/delM2-2; the basis for this is presently being investigated. This virus also was more immunogenic. There was no evidence of increased respiratory tract illness in vaccine versus placebo recipients except that one vaccinee had brief, mild LRT illness. This was concurrent with the shedding of vaccine virus as well as enterovirus/rhinovirus. Therefore, causality was unclear. Surveillance during the following RSV season showed that 8 vaccinees had strong boosts in RSV-neutralizing serum antibody titers but without medically-attended RSV disease, indicating strong anamnestic responses to wt RSV without illness. These results confirmed that the delM2-2 mutation is associated with increased immunogenicity, apparent protection, and very strong amnestic responses. RSV LID/delM2-2 may be insufficiently attenuated. It is possible that a delM2-2 mutant with replication properties intermediate between the MEDI and LID viruses would be optimal. To this end, we presently are evaluating 2 additional delM2-2 viruses in phase 1 pediatric clinical trials, namely RSV D46/cp/delM2-2 (NCT02601612) and LID/delM2-2/1030s (NCT02794870).The rA2cp248/404/1030delSH virus mentioned above, which was a previous lead candidate, contains a series of point mutations and deletion of the SH gene, and is highly temperature-sensitive, but exhibits genetic instability involving at least 2 attenuating point mutations in the L protein called 248 and 1030. We previously developed new versions of these 2 mutations that were modified for increased genetic stability. A version of the rA2cp248/404/1030delSH virus was created that incorporated these stabilized mutations, resulting in a virus called RSV cps2. This virus was evaluated in a phase 1 pediatric clinical trial in seronegative children 6-24 months of age (34 vaccinees and 17 placebo recipients; NCT01852266 and NCT01968083), in collaboration with JHU and IMPAACT. Without going into detail, this showed that this virus indeed is less immunogenic than the delM2-2-based viruses noted above (which had been evaluated approximately in parallel), and thus this particular backbone will not be further developed at this time. However, sequence analysis of shed vaccine virus from vaccinees indicated an absence of de-attenuation at the attenuating mutation 248 or 1030, indicating that substantial stabilization of these mutations indeed had been achieved. These stabilized attenuating mutations presently are being used in other vaccine candidates (such as LID/delM2-2/1030s noted above).We also are evaluating another RSV vaccine candidate called RSV delNS2del1313. This virus contains the deletion of the nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) gene, whose encoded protein antagonizes host responses to viral infection, notably the type I interferon (IFN) response. It also contains deletion of codon 1313 in the polymerase L protein. This virus is being evaluated in a phase 1 pediatric clinical trial (NCT01893554) presently in progress.Thus, we have several promising RSV platforms in phase 1 pediatric clinical trials. Our goal is to perform a number of small phase 1 studies in 2016, 2017, and possibly 2018 to identify a lead candidate and a back-up candidate to bring forward to larger studies.Wild type (wt) RSV:We prepared a clinical trial lot of wt RSV strain A2 produced from cDNA. This provides a virus with a well-defined passage history and reduced possibility of adventitious agents. In collaboration with the Medical Virology Section, this virus presently is being evaluated in an in-patient setting for infectivity, replication, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity in healthy adult volunteers in a dose-escalation study (NCT02484417). This will provide an infection model that can be used to evaluate anti-RSV drug candidates and adult RSV vaccine candidates, and to study viral pathogenesis and the host response.HPIV1 vaccine: We previously developed an HPIV1 vaccine candidate called rHPIV1-C(R84G/del170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) that includes mutations that were engineered for genetic stability. A phase 1 trial in seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (NCT00641017) showed that this virus is over-attenuated. Over-attenuation can be corrected by reverse genetics.HPIV2 vaccine: We previously developed an HPIV2 vaccine candidate called rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/1724 that includes stabilized mutations. This virus presently is being evaluated in a phase 1 trial in seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age, which will be followed by evaluation in seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (NCT01139437).HMPV vaccine: We previously developed an HMPV vaccine virus called rHMPV-Pa in which the HMPV P gene was replaced by that of avian MPV, thus conferring a host range attenuation phenotype. A phase 1 trial in seronegative children 6-59 months of age (NCT01255410) showed that this virus is over-attenuated. This provides a benchmark for pre-clinical comparison with other existing vaccine candidates to identify ones that are less attenuated.These were the first live-attenuated HPIV1, 2, and HMPV vaccines to be evaluated in humans.',\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent discoveries on small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have significantly advanced human genetics and molecular biology, largely due to the identification of a fundamental role of sncRNAs as gene regulators. tRNA- derived RNA Fragments (tRFs) represent a recently discovered sncRNA family that is quickly being recognized as ubiquitously expressed in organisms ranging from prokaryotes to humans; however, tRFs' biological functions and the mechanism(s) underlying them are largely unknown. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the single most common cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infants. Our recent publication has shown that the sncRNAs most highly induced by RSV belong to the tRF family. Notably, at least the two most abundant RSV-inducible tRFs have a gene trans-silencing function that is mechanistically distinct from that of miRNAs, and one of these two, called tRF5-GluCTC, promotes RSV replication and regulates genes at a post-transcriptional level. The biogenesis of this tRF is also specific, and mediated by a particular endonuclease (angiogenin, ANG), and not by other nucleases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological functions and induction of tRF5-GluCTC are not known. Our central hypothesis in this project is that the RSV-induced tRF5-GluCTC is not a random by-product of tRNA degradation, but rather a functional molecule important for host-RSV interactions. This project will focus on exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulatory effects of tRF5-GluCTC on RSV replication, and the host responses thereto. Our experiments will identify the targets of tRF5-GluCTC in RSV- infected airway epithelial cells (Aim 1), determine the viral factor(s) controlling the trans-silencing activity of tRF5- GluCTC (Aim 2), and define the viral component(s) contributing to ANG-mediated biogenesis of tRFs (Aim 3). Preliminary data suggest that the RSV proteins N and P will be a focus of Aims 2 and 3, respectively. The overall goal of this project is to use a combination of molecular virology, protein and RNA biochemistry, and cellular and structural biology techniques to elucidate tRF-mediated regulatory mechanisms for both RSV replication and the host responses it elicits. This novel regulation should provide a key new perspective on RSV-host interactions and undoubtedly facilitate the discovery of new gene regulatory mechanisms in response to RSV infection. Our results on antiviral target identification, targeting mechanisms, and tRF biogenesiswill also provide new insights important for the design of preventive and therapeutic strategies for RSV infection. Given the early stage of studies on tRFs, the knowledge and techniques obtained in this study on tRF5-GluCTC will be important for exploring the functions of other tRFs in various biological systems, and therefore will broadly benefit the research community.\",\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most acute viral respiratory disease in infants and young children is due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This virus also causes serious disease in elderly and immunocompromised populations and is a significant cause of morbidity in healthy adult populations. Despite the substantial disease burden due to this virus worldwide, there are no vaccines available. Several problems have impeded RSV vaccine development. First is safety. An early formalin-inactivated vaccine (FI-RSV), which stimulated weak and unbalanced immune responses, predisposed infants to more severe disease upon natural exposure to live virus. A second problem is the failure of many vaccine candidates to stimulate protective immune responses. A third problem is the failure of natural infection as well as vaccine candidates to stimulate long-lived, protective memory responses. All these problems are ultimately due to a lack of understanding of mechanisms involved in stimulation of protective as well as durable anti-RSV immune responses. This proposal will test the hypothesis that different conformational forms of RSV F protein impact the properties of anti-RSV immune responses. The goal is to define conformations of RSV F protein, expressed on virus-like particles, that stimulate high titer neutralizing antibodies and protective, long-lived and memory immune responses and to understand the mechanisms responsible for generation of these responses. To test the hypothesis, four aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1: to characterize the RSV F protein binding properties of antibodies stimulated in mice and in cotton rats by VLPs containing stabilized pre-fusion or stabilized post-fusion F protein. Specific Aim 2: to clarify th role of anti-G antibodies in the neutralization titers induced in mice and cotton rats by VLPs containing the pre-fusion form of the RSV F protein and VLPs containing the post-fusion form. Specific Aim 3: to characterize immune responses to VLPs containing pre- and post-fusion forms of F in RSV experienced mice and cotton rats as models for maternal immunization. Specific Aim 4: to determine if VLPs containing the pre-fusion and the post-fusion F proteins induce RSV F protein specific long-lived bone marrow associated plasma cells (LLPC) and memory B cells in both mice and cotton rats.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a K08 award for Ann Dennis MD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, who is training to become an independent investigator in HIV transmission, epidemiology, and prevention. Despite marked advances in HIV treatment and prevention, new HIV diagnoses continue in the southeastern US where significant disparities still exist among racial minorities and men who have sex with men. Innovative methods are needed to successfully decrease incident HIV infections among these vulnerable groups. The identification of phylogenetic HIV transmission networks or  clusters , which are highly related sequences from individuals with shared HIV transmission, offers unique insight into the structure of HIV transmission on a population level that cannot be obtained through contact tracing or other patient-reported history. Paired with clinical and demographic data, these transmission clusters may provide new targets to direct HIV prevention efforts for groups at highest risk for ongoing transmission. The overall research objective is to characterize local phylogenetic clusters in North Carolina and investigate the use of phylogeny in the public health setting to target future interventions. The proposed study will employ innovative methods in molecular epidemiology to reconstruct transmission clusters using large repositories of HIV pol sequences extracted from antiretroviral resistance testing sent during routine clinical care. The aims of the study are to: 1) Identify the temporal and clinical features of emerging or expanding HIV transmission clusters in a large clinical cohort of new and established HIV cases; 2) Assess the effect of higher density sampling of prevalent HIV cases on the detection of transmission clusters and characterize the statewide epidemic structure; and 3) Determine feasibility of incorporating HIV sequence analysis into routine HIV surveillance in a circumscribed geographic area. Dr. Dennis's mentoring team will consist of primary mentor Joseph Eron, MD, Professor of Medicine at UNC with over 20 years of experience in HIV clinical and epidemiologic research. Two co-mentors will offer complementary areas of expertise in HIV epidemiology and phylogenetics: William Miller, MD, PhD, MPH, Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Medicine at UNC whose research focuses on HIV epidemiology; and Stephane Hue, PhD, virologist at University College London, an internationally recognized expert in HIV phylogenetics and UNC collaborator since 2010. Dr. Dennis' training plan links to the proposed research aims: establish a solid foundation in HIV epidemiology including surveillance and outbreak investigation; expand skills in phylogenetic analyses integrating time- scaled and geographic data; and explore ethical issues surrounding phylogenetics in HIV prevention. Training will be accomplished through a combination of didactic courses, workshops, and practicums. These training and research activities will allow Dr. Dennis to mature into an independent investigator and provide a basis for an R01 to implement real-time phylogeny to direct prevention interventions and track trends in HIV incidence.\",\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will investigate microglial involvement in cognitive impairment after surgery and general anesthesia. Cognitive impairment is prevalent and persistent in older surgical patients and associated with higher morbidity and cost. The cause is unknown but CNS inflammation is implicated. Microglia, the resident immune competent cells of the CNS, are major effectors of CNS inflammation, but until recently it was difficult to distinguish between resident microglia and myeloid cells that infiltrate the CNS durin stress because there were no known microglia specific genes encoding cell surface proteins. This is critical because resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages have separate and distinct immune functions. We propose a transcriptome / proteomincs / bioinformatics approach using a recently discovered unique molecular signature for microglia to investigate age-dependent microglia biology during and after surgery and anesthesia. Using such tools, we found there are fewer microglia in the old brain, that they express lower levels of immune-related and homeostatic genes, and that isoflurane anesthesia affects microglia in young vs. old mice differently. Based on these data, we propose microglial attrition and dysregulation in the old CNS are responsible for vulnerability to cognitive impairment after surgery and that surgery. Here we will identify the impact of surgery and general anesthesia on the molecular and functional signature of microglia; investigate the contribution of microglia to postoperative CNS inflammation and cognitive impairment using microglial ablation / replenishment; and rescue age-dependent cognitive vulnerability to surgery and anesthesia by immunomodulating microglia. Upon completion of the project, we will understand age differences in the molecular and functional properties of microglia, the role of resident microglia vs. infiltrating myeloid cels in surgery- induced CNS inflammation and cognitive decline, and how general anesthesia affects the process and defined a strategy for specifically targeting microglia to restore their homeostatic molecular signature, reduce CNS inflammation, and improve postoperative cognitive outcome in older subjects. Importantly, we will also specifically target microglia to restore their homeostatic molecular signature in order to reduce CNS inflammation and improve postoperative cognitive outcome. The work proposed is innovative because it uses state-of- the art methods and technology to explore a novel microglial mechanism for postoperative cognitive decline in older patients and significant because of the scale of the clinical problem and potential to identify new ways of preventing it.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of severe acute lower respiratory tract infection in infants and children worldwide. Bovine RSV (BRSV) is closely related to human RSV and a significant cause of morbidity in young cattle. BRSV infection in calves displays many striking similarities to HRSV infection in humans, and cattle are an outbred population that is naturally susceptible to BRSV infection. Therefore, BRSV infection in calves represents an excellent model for studying RSV infection and antiviral immunity in children. RSV is poorly immunogenic and this has been a complicating factor in the development of a safe and effective RSV vaccine. Polyanhydride nanovaccines have shown great promise as adjuvants and vaccine delivery vehicles in rodent models due to their ability to promote enhanced immunogenicity through both the route of administration and the ability to provide sustained antigen exposure. The experiments in Aim 1 are designed to examine the efficacy of a novel amphiphilic polyanhydride nanoparticle vaccine bearing the recombinant BRSV F and G glycoproteins in a neonatal calf model of RSV infection. Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a widespread affliction in infants and young children worldwide. Vitamin A is a critical factor in regulating the immune response and even marginal levels of VAD are associated with impaired immune function and increased susceptibility to respiratory infections, particularly those caused by RSV. Further, VAD has been linked to poor vaccine efficacy. However, despite the strong epidemiologic link between VAD and RSV disease incidence and severity, there exists little experimental evidence for vitamin A in regulating the immune response to RSV infection or vaccination. Therefore, the experiments in Aim 2 will use the model of RSV infection in the calf to determine the role of vitamin A in regulating the immune response to RSV vaccination and infection. Much of our knowledge of RSV infection and immunity stems from studies in rodents and adult animals; however, the experiments proposed here will study a natural host-pathogen interaction and will examine the response in the neonate, the same population commonly targeted by severe disease. It is anticipated that these studies will have a positive impact by identifying a safe and efficacious vaccine for use in children and animals, and by determining the role of vitamin A in the response to both vaccination and infection.',\n",
       " 'The electric power transmission infrastructure in the United States, especially in coastal areas, faces substantial risk from hurricanes. Considering the significant size of the transmission grid, the cost of upgrading the entire infrastructure to achieve acceptable performance levels against hurricanes would be extremely high. The objective of this research is to investigate a framework to reliably identify vulnerable transmission line systems and provide cost-effective retrofit solutions to reduce their likelihood of damage and loss of functionality during hurricanes and their recovery time following the event. For this purpose, this project will develop multi-dimensional fragility models for transmission tower-line systems using experimentally validated numerical models.  This will enable characterization of the effects of various significant factors on the wind performance of these systems. Outcomes of this research will aid in minimizing societal disruptions due to loss of functioning of critical infrastructure and facilities caused by power outages. The project will actively engage stakeholders to facilitate technology transfer and implementation of novel design and retrofit solutions for transmission systems.  The research findings will be integrated into courses at Ohio State University and Florida International University (FIU). In addition, underrepresented undergraduate and K-8 students will be trained in research on infrastructure systems to prepare the next generation of engineers to enhance the hurricane resilience of communities.The research will produce a state-of-the-art experimentally validated stochastic numerical framework to generate multi-dimensional fragility models for hurricane resilience enhancement of transmission systems. The research will involve a series of aeroelastic wind tunnel studies on the wind response of multi-span transmission systems at the National Science Foundation-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Wall of Wind (WOW) Experimental Facility at FIU. These novel sets of experimental data, together with high-fidelity three-dimensional nonlinear finite element models of tower-conductor-insulator-foundation systems, will provide new and critical insights into various complex wind-induced behaviors of these systems. The WOW tests will also enable characterization of dynamic boundary effects from neighboring spans. The multi-dimensional fragility surfaces, based on validated numerical models, will provide component- and system-level structural and functional failure probabilities for units of transmission tower-lines. The generated reliability models, combined with recovery models, will be integrated into optimization frameworks to provide optimal design and retrofit solutions based on hazard and environmental factors, which will facilitate optimal management of transmission systems against hurricane hazards to enhance their resilience in response to extreme events.',\n",
       " 'This RAPID award will address gaps in our knowledge about i) the time it takes for the Zika virus to become infectious in a mosquito, ii) the proportion of a mosquito population that becomes infectious, and iii) mosquito survival in the two Aedes species shown to transmit the Zika virus, species that are also found in the United States. To predict the seasonal and geographic distribution of potential outbreaks, the project will examine temperature and transmission relationships that can alter viral dynamics in the mosquito. This study will enhance our understanding of how Zika and other pathogens are transmitted and will help in the design of control measures. There is an urgent need to understand and predict the emergence and transmission potential of Zika because of its unique characteristics, e.g., fetal abnormalities and the potential of transporting Zika to new regions of the world, including the United States. Results from this project will be relevant to the Zika public health emergency, and the researchers have set in place mechanisms to share quality-assured interim and final data as rapidly and widely as possible, including with public health and research communities.This project will characterize Zika viral dynamics, which impact the transmission potential. The study will evaluate the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), vector competence, and mosquito survival in field-derived Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus. These characteristics will be examined using a range of viral doses reflective of asymptomatic and symptomatic human infections. The study investigates the relationship between temperature and transmission potential to predict the seasonal and geographic Zika transmission models for these two species. From these results, predictive models of Zika transmission and sensitivity analyses will be used to assess mosquito control efficiency. Ultimately, this project will produce a framework for assessing sources of environmental, genetic, and anthropogenic variation that influence disease transmission and risk from these mosquitos.',\n",
       " \"Objective(s): Objective 1. Using and developing genetic resources and associated information of the ARS Collection of Entomopathogenic Fungal Cultures (ARSEF), conserve, characterize (including taxonomic revision), and exchange insect pathogenic fungi such as Beauveria, Metarhizium, and Hirsutella species complexes to facilitate use of these fungi as biocontrol agents of key arthropod pests and disease vectors. Subobjective 1.1. Continue the curation, operation, and expansion of the ARSEF culture collection and associated information resources. Subobjective 1.2. Improve methods to isolate, culture, and preserve fungal entomopathogens.  Subobjective 1.3. Conduct research on the systematics, taxonomy, and organismal biology of these fungi.  Objective 2. Identify genetic, environmental and behavioral mechanisms that regulate circulative transmission of insect-borne plant pathogens.  Subobjective 2.1. Identification of pathogen, host, and vector components that regulate uptake and transmission of pathogens by sap-sucking insects.  Subobjective 2.2. Functional analysis of genes, proteins and metabolites involved in circulative plant pathogen transmission.   Objective 3. Explore the utility of novel interdiction molecules that could interfere with plant pathogen acquisition and transmission. Subobjective 3.1. Continue efforts to define the chemistry of fungal secondary metabolites and characterize their effects on phloem-feeding insects, their endosymbionts, and on plant pathogen transmission. Subobjective 3.2. Develop RNA aptamers that bind to transmission related compounds and test their ability to interfere with pathogen acquisition and transmission.  Approach: Control of arthropods that transmit pathogens is arguably one of the biggest challenges to human health and agriculture. Many serious plant and animal pathogens are dependent upon arthropod vectors for transmission between hosts.  Nearly all arthropod-transmitted animal pathogens are internalized and circulate in their insect vectors, while plant pathogens are divided between those that circulate in their vectors and those that are carried on the cuticle linings of mouthparts and foreguts. The mechanisms of circulative transmission are only beginning to be dissected, but already commonalities among transmission of both circulative plant and animal pathogens have been discovered. Our experimental systems offer innovative approaches to manage circulative-transmitted plant pathogens that have been recalcitrant to the development of host resistance and for which the economic and environmental costs of vector control has been prohibitive, unsustainable and/or ineffective.  Scientists' incomplete understanding of interactions among insect vectors, plant pathogens and plant hosts limits the development of new tools to block or interfere with pathogen transmission by insects in the field.  We address this problem by attempting to discover genes and products that mediate the associations among insect vectors, circulative plant pathogens and plant hosts. The new technologies and knowledge are expected to be extended and applied to the study of other circulative pathogens and will greatly impact growers, industry stakeholders, and other research communities.   The project will also focus on maintaining the extensive ARS Collection of Entomopathogenic Fungal Cultures (ARSEF).  ARSEF contains 12,500 isolates representing 700 fungal taxa from 1,300 hosts and 2,400 locations worldwide, and will be managed to ensure ongoing accession, preservation, identification, and distribution of fungal isolates for development and deployment as biocontrol agents and for research purposes. The ARSEF collection also plays a central role in revising taxonomies of fungi using the state-of-the-art systematic methods.\",\n",

       " 'Relevance:  Military training and exercises expose troops and military working dogs to tick-infested habitats where Ehrlichia spp. are highly endemic.  Since 1989, the US Army has had a Tick Surveillance program in place to track exposure of Soldiers to various tick-borne diseases, including human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) from military installations in the mid-Atlantic, south, northeast, and upper Midwest regions.  Indeed the tick-borne pathogen Ehrlichia chaffeensis (Ech) that causes HME was first isolated from a Soldier stationed at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas and named after Fort Chaffee.  Studies of Soldiers in military training exercises carried out in areas where Ech is endemic have shown a high prevalence of seropositivity to Ech and related pathogens.  Importantly, tick-borne diseases such as HME are considered a health threat to US personnel stationed around the world because human ehrlichiosis is endemic or potentially endemic in 26 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America.  It is also possible that Soldiers could contract Ech via blood transfusion or organ transplantation, even by exposure to the blood from infected humans or animals.  Moreover, Ech has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood.  An even higher risk of exposure to vector-borne disease exists for the US military working dogs during training and global deployment.  Dogs are highly susceptible to tick-borne pathogens including Ech, and thus can serve as sentinels as well as useful animal models.  The project is relevant to the Fiscal Year 2016 Tick-Borne Diseases Research Program Focus Areas of Pathogenesis and Prevention.Background:  Ech is an obligatory intracellular bacterium of the order Rickettsiales.  Ech replicates within human blood monocytes and causes HME, a severe systemic flu-like illness accompanied by hematologic abnormalities and mild hepatitis.  The current therapy of choice is the broad-spectrum antibiotic doxycycline, but it is effective only if initiated early because of delayed therapy initiation; thus, for example, under battle circumstances in the field, infection can lead to severe complications or death.  Also, the presence of underlying illness or injury, stress, immunosuppression, and/or co-infection with other tick-borne pathogens can lead to severe complications or death with a mortality rate of 2%-5%.  No vaccines exist for HME.  We recently discovered that a unique Ech surface-exposed outer-membrane protein (ECH1038), Entry triggering protein of Ehrlichia (EtpE), is an invasin that is essential to monocytic infection by Ech because antibody against EtpE-C (the C-terminal fragment that is absolutely conserved among Ech strains) greatly inhibited Ech binding, entry, and infection of host cells.  Moreover, immunization of mice against EtpE-C significantly inhibited Ech infection upon intraperitoneal Ech challenge.  However, whether EtpE is also used by Ech to transmit from tick to mammalian cells is currently unknown.  By investigating the role of EtpE in Ech transmission from the primary vector of Ech, Amblyomma americanum ticks to mammals, our proposed research will fill current gaps in our understanding on Ech transmission, paving the way for their development in future human validation.Hypothesis/Objective:  Our hypothesis is EtpE-mediated Ech entry is critical for transmission; thus, EtpE-C immunization will prevent Ech transmission from ticks to mammals.Specific Aims:Aim 1: We will determine whether EtpE mRNA and protein are expressed by Ech in tick cells, and if anti-EtpEC prevents Ech transmission from tick to human cells in culture by analyzing: (1) EtpE expression by Ech in A. americanum tick cells by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis, and (2) whether anti-EtpE-C can block Ech transmission from tick cells to human leukocytes by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunofluorescence labeling.Aim 2:  We will test whether EtpE is expressed by Ech in transmission feeding ticks and if immunization of dogs with EtpE-C can block Ech transmission from infected ticks to dogs by analyzing: (1) EtpE mRNA expression by Ech in salivary gland and midgut tissues of A. americanum ticks during transmission feeding by qRT-PCR, and (2) whether dogs immunized with recombinant EtpE-C develop specific and high titer antibodies against the immunogen without any adverse effects, and whether dogs are protected from Ech infection by allowing infected ticks to feed on dogs, and testing Ech infection of dogs by qPCR.Impact:  The immediate outcomes of the proposed studies will be the proof-of-principle for immunization of EtpE-C for blocking of Ech transmission from ticks to dogs.  The long-term outcomes will be development of an anti-infective vaccine against HME in humans without adverse side effects.',\n",
       " '7. Project Summary/AbstractA current unmet clinical need is a commercial vaccine to protect at risk populations (the very youngand the elderly) against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) – a respiratory pathogen that annually inthe US causes 172,000 hospitalizations and 1.5 million outpatient visits in children 14,000 deaths in those over 65. The burden of this pathogen is even more pronounced in thedeveloping world. In this Direct to Phase II project, we will further commercialize candidate live-attenuated RSV vaccine strain we have developed using our vaccine design platform, SAVE(Synthetic Attenuated Virus Engineering) (Coleman, et al. 2008 Science). SAVE is unlike any vaccineplatform previously investigated – it does not use blind serial passaging, an attenuated carrierbackbone virus, or virus-like particles. SAVE utilizes genome de-optimization, and synonymous re-coding of viral ORFs to yield live-attenuated vaccine strains and has shown proof-of-concept in sevenunique viruses. These designer vaccine strains are 100% antigenically identical to the wild type andpresent all antigens of the target virus.Our SAVE-designed RSV vaccine strains were developed in collaboration with pre-eminent RSVscientist Dr. Peter Collins of NIH-NIAID. We now have lead candidate, RSV-MinA, that is highlyattenuated and shown to induce immunity in non-human primates, efficacy in Cotton Rats,and the recently demonstrated ability to neutralize human clinical RSV isolates of A and Bsubtypes. Furthermore, we have demonstrated genetic and phenotypic stability of MinA after serialpassage. Based on our early success in primates, in August 2016 Codagenix was granted a secondno fee NIAID-DMID service contract (#:VM16RDB640; PO: Kim) in support of this project to executeProcess Development to develop a cGMP compliant manufacturing process for our lead RSV vaccinecandidate MinA in preparation of cGMP manufacturing of clinical lots.Vaccine commercialization is a costly and multi-faceted development process that requiresadherence to regulatory guidelines set by the FDA. Therefore, in this project we seek funds tosupport the other areas of pre-clinical development of these SAVE-designed RSV vaccine strains.These experiments include continued assaying for genetic/phenotypic stability, cGMP Master CellBank construction and characterization, cGMP clinical vaccine lot manufacturing, and GLP toxicology.At the end of this project, we will have produced a SAVE-RSV vaccine candidate ready for a Phase Iclinical trial.The overall goal of the proposed work is to further commercialize a live-attenuated RSV vaccine thatwill be administered intranasally. In the initial phases of this effort (pilot data akin to a Phase I SBIRgrant), Codagenix (in collaboration with Dr. Peter Collins at NIH) developed and characterized threepromising RSV vaccine candidates. Efficacy, safety, and demonstration of the induction of a cross-reactive immune response has now narrowed this field of candidates to a single candidate (RSV-MinA) ready for cGMP manufacturing. We seek funds to support all other aspect of pre-clinicaldevelopment to prepare this RSV vaccine for a Phase I trial.',\n",
       " 'This project conducts clinical trials of live intranasal pediatric vaccine candidates for human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 (HPIV1, 2, and 3), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV), with RSV being the most important vaccine target.RSV vaccine:The primary goal is to identify, in phase 1 pediatric clinical trials, one or more live-attenuated strains of RSV suitable for further development as a pediatric RSV vaccine, to be given by intranasal administration. We previously showed that deletion of the ORF encoding the small (90 amino acids) viral M2-2 protein (delM2-2) results in down-regulated viral RNA replication (causing viral attenuation) and up-regulated viral gene transcription and antigen synthesis, raising the possibility of increased immunogenicity. We have been evaluating several versions of delM2-2 viruses phase 1 clinical trials in RSV-seronegative children 6-24 months of age. First, a prototype virus called RSV MEDI/delM2-2 was evaluated with clinical collaborators at Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health (JHU; Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01459198). This showed that this virus was very highly attenuated for replication, and possibly was more attenuated than necessary. Nonetheless, compared to our previous lead RSV vaccine candidate, called rA2cp248/404/1030delSH, the MEDI/delM2-2 virus induced significantly higher titers of RSV-neutralizing serum antibodies. Thus, it indeed appeared to have increased immunogenicity per infectious unit. Surveillance during the subsequent RSV season provided presumptive evidence of protection and strong anamnestic antibody responses.A second delM2-2-based candidate, called RSV LID/M2-2, was evaluated in a similar phase 1 study by JHU plus the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) network (NCT02040831 and NCT02237209). Unexpectedly, the LID/delM2-2 virus was substantially less restricted than MEDI/delM2-2 and was deemed to be insufficiently attenuated. The basis for the difference in replication by these two viruses is presently being investigated. The LID/delM2-2 virus was more immunogenic than MEDI/delM2-2, presumably due to the increased replication. There was no evidence of increased respiratory tract illness in vaccine versus placebo recipients except that one vaccinee had brief, mild LRT illness. This was concurrent with the shedding of vaccine virus as well as enterovirus/rhinovirus. Therefore, causality was unclear. Surveillance during the subsequent RSV season provided presumptive evidence of protection and strong anamnestic antibody responses.Several other versions of RSV delM2-2 viruses presently are under evaluation in similar phase 1 trials, namely RSV D46/cp/delM2-2 (NCT02601612), RSV LID/delM2-2/1030s (NCT02794870 and NCT0252339), RSV LID/cp/delM2-2 (NCT02890381 and NCT02948127), and RSV D46/NS2/N/delM2-2 (NCT03099291 and NCT03102034). Ideally, we would like to identify a delM2-2 mutant with replication properties intermediate between the MEDI/delM2-2 and LID/delM2-2 viruses, with the idea that it would be desirable to have as much replication as is safe in order to enhance immunogenicity.The rA2cp248/404/1030delSH virus mentioned above, which was a previous lead candidate, contains a series of point mutations and deletion of the SH gene, and is highly temperature-sensitive. However, in a previous phase 1 clinical trial in seronegative infants and children 6-24 months of age, it exhibited genetic instability that primarily involved two attenuating point mutations in the L protein called 248 and 1030. We previously developed new versions of these two mutations that were modified for increased genetic stability (called 248s and 1030s). A version of the rA2cp248/404/1030delSH virus was created that incorporated these stabilized mutations, resulting in a virus called RSV cps2. This virus has now been evaluated in a phase 1 pediatric clinical trial in seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT01852266 and NCT01968083), in collaboration with JHU and IMPAACT. Consistent with the results from its parent, this virus was highly attenuated but was less immunogenic than the delM2-2-based viruses noted above. Sequence analysis of shed vaccine virus from vaccinees indicated an absence of de-attenuation at the stabilized attenuating mutations 248s or 1030s, indicating that substantial stabilization of these mutations indeed had been achieved. Thus, the cps-2 virus is a feasible vaccine candidate, although at the present time we are focusing on viruses like the delM2-2 viruses that may be more effective. The stabilized 1030 mutation presently is being used in other vaccine candidates (such as LID/delM2-2/1030s noted above).We are evaluating another RSV vaccine candidate called RSV delNS2/del1313/I1314L. This virus contains the deletion of the nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) gene, whose encoded protein antagonizes host responses to viral infection, notably the type I interferon (IFN) response. It also contains a stabilized mutation in the polymerase L protein that we previously developed, and which consists of deletion of codon 1313 combined with a I1314L missense mutation. This virus is being evaluated in a phase 1 pediatric clinical trial (NCT01893554) presently in progress.Thus, we have several promising RSV candidates in phase 1 pediatric clinical trials. Our goal is to identify two lead candidates to bring forward to larger studies in 2018.Wild type (wt) RSV:We prepared a clinical trial lot of wt RSV strain A2 produced from cDNA. This provides a virus with a well-defined passage history and reduced possibility of adventitious agents. In collaboration with the Medical Virology Section, this virus presently is being evaluated in an in-patient setting for infectivity, replication, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity in healthy adult volunteers in a dose-escalation study (NCT02484417). This will provide an infection model that can be used to evaluate anti-RSV drug candidates and adult RSV vaccine candidates, and to study viral pathogenesis and the host response.HPIV1 vaccine: We previously developed and evaluated an HPIV1 vaccine candidate called rHPIV1-C(R84G/del170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A), which includes stabilized mutations, in seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (NCT00641017) and showed that it is over-attenuated. Over-attenuation can be corrected by reverse genetics.HPIV2 vaccine: We developed and are evaluating an HPIV2 vaccine candidate called rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/1724, which includes stabilized mutations, in seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (NCT01139437).HMPV vaccine: We previously developed an HMPV vaccine virus called rHMPV-Pa in which the HMPV P gene was replaced by that of avian MPV, thus conferring a host range attenuation phenotype. A phase 1 trial in seronegative children 6-59 months of age (NCT01255410) showed that this virus is over-attenuated. This provides a benchmark for pre-clinical comparison with other existing vaccine candidates to identify ones that are less attenuated.These were the first live-attenuated HPIV1, 2, and HMPV vaccines to be evaluated in humans.',\n",
       " 'Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatotropic DNA virus that replicates by reverse transcription. It chronically infects 350 million people and kills >600,000 annually. Therapy employs nucleos(t)ide analogs that usually drive HBV to at or below the clinical limit of detection. However, viral replication is not ablated and HBV resurges if drug is withdrawn, so therapy is life-long. Nevertheless, treatment cures up to 6% of patients, so many more patients could be helped by suppressing HBV further. HBV reverse transcription requires the viral ribonuclease H (RNaseH) to destroy the RNA after it has been copied into DNA. Inhibiting the RNaseH blocks viral replication, but anti-RNaseH drugs have not been designed due to technical limitations. We recently developed the first HBV RNaseH inhibitor screening pipeline. We screened >280 compounds containing pharmacophores that inhibit the HIV RNaseH for the ability to block the HBV RNaseH and HBV replication. 41 compounds were N-hydroxyisoquinolinediones (HID), N- hydroxypyridinediones (HPD), or related polyoxygenated heterocycles. Thirteen of these compounds inhibited suppressed viral replication in cells. The most effective HPD/HID compound has an EC50 of 0.57 µM against HBV replication in culture (therapeutic index = 26). These compounds chelate Mg++ in the RNaseH active site, as expected from studies on the HIV RNaseH. Here, Drs. Tavis (virologist) and Meyers (medicinal chemist) will conduct an interdisciplinary exploratory R21 project to answer 2 questions needed to generate HPD/HID leads for anti-HBV drug development. Aim 1. What types of modifications to the HPD/HID pharmacophore improve efficacy? We will synthesize a diverse series of ~70 derivatives of the HPD/HID scaffold including predictive characteristics (CLogP, ALOGpS, etc.) in the design and evaluate their efficacy against viral replication. We will assess drug- like properties such as stability in microsomal extracts and hepatocytes for the best compounds. Compound synthesis will be iterative, with results from the initial compounds informing design of later ones. Aim 2. What are the best approaches to maximize selectivity of HPD/HIDs for the HBV RNaseH? Curative anti-HBV therapy is likely to last for many months, so high selectivity for the HBV enzyme and low cytotoxicity will be key. We will counter-screen all compounds against the human RNaseH1 and carefully assess cytotoxicity for the best compounds. Aims 1 and 2 will be conducted concurrently so selectivity and cytotoxicity issues can be addressed during iterative compound design. These R21 studies will generate a structure-activity relationships (SAR) for the HPD/HID pharmacophore that will guide medicinal chemistry optimization, leading to candidate anti-HBV drugs. RNaseH drugs are anticipated to be used in combination with the nucleos(t)ide analogs to suppress HBV replication far enough to clear HBV in many more patients than the current monotherapies can achieve.',\n",
       " '\\ufeffDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of infant hospitalization, and severe RSV bronchiolitis has been identified as a risk factor for th subsequent development of asthma in children. There is no currently available therapy for RSV bronchiolitis. Moreover, no vaccine is FDA-approved and the only prevention option for RSV infection is palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the RSV fusion protein. Given the frequency and severity of infection, the development of new treatment options is imperative. Our preliminary data suggest that exogenous prostaglandin (PG) I2 is a novel therapeutic target for RSV. Our group reported that mice that constitutively overexpress PGI synthase (PGIS) were significantly protected from RSV-induced illness. In addition, we found that mice which cannot signal through the PGI2 receptor (IP) had significantly exacerbated weight loss and delayed recovery after RSV infection. In a collaborative study of infants admitted with RSV bronchiolitis, we found that a functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the PGI synthase (PGIS) gene was associated with an increase in the urinary PGI2 metabolite and less severe RSV bronchiolitis. These data strongly support that endogenous PGI2 protects against RSV-induced illness. To pave the way for a clinical effectiveness study using PGI2 for the treatment of RSV infection, we must perform preclinical studies to determine how exogenous PGI2 regulates RSV-induced illness and determine the mechanisms by which exogenous PGI2 modulates host antiviral immunity. Interleukin 13 (IL-13) can be produced by T helper 2 (Th2) cells and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). During RSV infection, IL-13 mediates mucus production, which directly contributes to airway obstruction and respiratory failure. On the other hand, IL-10, which can be produced by T regulatory cells (Tregs), inhibits RSV-induced inflammation. RSV-specific CD8+ T cells are a major source of IFN-γ, which limits viral replication. I found significantly decreased lung IL-13 accompanied by increased lung IL-10 and IFN-γ in RSV-infected mice treated with exogenous PGI2. Accordingly, I hypothesize that exogenous PGI2 attenuates IL-13 producing- Th2 cells and ILC2s while enhancing IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells and IL-10-producing Tregs during RSV infection, resulting in decreased RSV-induced illness. In Aim 1, I hypothesize that exogenous PGI2 inhibits RSV-induced Th2 cell and ILC2 cytokine expression and proliferation, while enhancing Treg cytokine expression and proliferation, resulting in attenuated mucus production. In Aim 2, I hypothesize that exogenous PGI2 enhances RSV-specific CD8+ T cell activation and proliferation, resulting in decreased viral replication during RSV infection. These studies will advance the field in that they will determine how PGI2, an FDA-approved agent, attenuates RSV illness. The current availability of PGI2 for human treatment highlights the clinical significance of my studies as this therapy could be immediately transferrable to RSV disease.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACTInfluenza remains an important preventable cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The primary strategyto attenuate the impact of influenza epidemics is vaccination, but vaccine effectiveness is suboptimal.Additionally, in the event of a pandemic, vaccines may not be available. Alternative methods to prevent thespread of influenza are needed but little is known about the spread of infection in households and communitiesin our modern lifestyle. Current surveillance activities do not allow for the characterization of the transmissiondynamics of influenza in the community. Understanding the contemporary patterns and timing of influenzainfection within households and communities is the foundation for preventative interventions such as home-quarantine, prophylactic use of antivirals, social distancing, school-closures, and vaccination. It is believed thatup to 30% of influenza transmission occurs in households. Our understanding of influenza transmission inhouseholds and communities has been largely based on studies that were done several decades ago.Diagnostic tests have changed and current molecular and sequencing techniques provide new opportunities tostudy influenza transmission. Similarly, social interaction patterns within households and communities havelikely changed during the last decades, and the widespread availability and use of personal electronic devicesmay have further modified the dynamic of human contacts within households. Thus, transmission patterns mayhave changed. Prospective efficient household transmission studies are needed to understand the currentdynamics of influenza transmission within households and to identify complementary strategies for diseaseprevention and control. During three consecutive years, we will conduct a case-ascertained study to determinethe transmission of influenza in households, with the following specific aims: 1. To determine the risk ofsecondary influenza transmission in households over three consecutive influenza seasons; 2. To determine theeffectiveness of influenza vaccination (VE) against secondary influenza transmission in households over threeconsecutive influenza seasons.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACTRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of severe respiratory disease in children, the elderly andimmunocompromised individuals. There is currently no licensed RSV vaccine. High titers of RSV-specificantibodies can provide protection against severe RSV-induced disease; however, even the highest antibodytiters fail to protect some individuals against RSV reinfection and disease. Thus, the correlates of protectiveimmunity against RSV remain unclear. Memory CD8 T cells can provide protective immunity against a widerange of acute viral infections, including respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and the severe acuterespiratory syndrome (SARS) human coronavirus. In most virus infections, memory CD8 T cells mediate viralclearance without causing substantial damage to the infected host. Because it is clear that antibodies aloneare not sufficient to provide complete protection against RSV infection, we hypothesized that induction of astrong pre-existing RSV-specific memory CD8 T cell response in the absence of RSV-specific memory CD4 Tcells and antibodies would provide protective immunity against an RSV infection. In order to test ourhypothesis we modified an accelerated prime/boost approach to generate robust pre-existing memory CD8 Tcell populations specific to the immunodominant M282-90 epitope. Our preliminary data indicate that RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells can significantly inhibit viral replication, but unexpectedly do so at the cost ofcausing fatal immunopathology upon RSV challenge. Importantly, the immunopathology was not an inherentproperty of the T cells, as RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells were capable of mediating protection withoutimmunopathology against a lethal challenge with a recombinant influenza virus expressing the RSV-derivedM282-90 epitope. Our data reveal that the design of a strictly T cell-based RSV vaccine could have severeconsequences. Thus, important knowledge gaps exist regarding how RSV-specific memory CD8 T cellsfunction to control RSV infection and the mechanisms that result in the development of immunopathology. Thegoal of this proposal is to address these critical knowledge gaps and provide mechanistic insight into if memoryCD8 T cells can be manipulated to confer optimal protective immunity against RSV infection. We will achievethese goals by pursuing the following three specific aims: Aim 1. Determine the mechanism of memory CD8 Tcell-mediated immunopathology following RSV infection. Aim 2. Investigate the characteristics of memoryCD8 T cells that enhance immunity and limit immunopathology after RSV challenge. Aim 3. Define theoptimal correlates of protection against RSV infection. The knowledge gained from these studies will providevital information regarding the correlates of protective immunity to RSV, information that will greatly impact thedesign and evaluation of future RSV vaccine candidates.!',\n",
       " 'Project summary/abstractInfluenza viruses emerge unpredictably from their reservoirs in aquatic birds to cause pandemics in humans.The processes by which avian influenza viruses adapt to replication and transmission in mammals has beenthe subject of intense study, with much work focused on identifying specific molecular determinants that con-fer mammalian-transmissible phenotypes. Dr. Friedrich’s group uses deep sequencing to focus not on specificmutations, but rather on the evolutionary processes by which host-adapting changes in influenza viruses aregenerated and selected. This work has shown that natural selection on hemagglutinin (HA) can imposea significant genetic bottleneck on avian influenza viruses during transmission between mammals. Inparallel, Dr. Mehle’s group developed a novel bioluminescent reporter virus that allows for direct in-vivo imag-ing of influenza replication in ferrets. This work revealed that airborne transmission can result in infectionof distinct respiratory tract compartments in different animals. Such localized replication suggests thatairborne transmission is subject to physical constraints that could act to randomly reduce viral genetic diver-sity. Indeed, it has become clear that airborne transmission of influenza viruses is associated with a geneticbottleneck, a previously unappreciated determinant of host adaptation by influenza viruses. The transmis-sion bottleneck has been variously reported to be governed by random events or by natural selection on viralgenes. The relative contributions of selective and random processes to the transmission bottleneckprofoundly influence the rate of influenza viral evolution: Strong selective effects would effectively amplifyfit variants from within the viral swarm. If random effects predominate, low-frequency fit variants would likelybe lost to genetic drift before they find a susceptible host. We present here a conceptual model that unifiesprevious findings on influenza transmission bottlenecks, and suggests that strongly selective bottlenecksare signature features of viruses in transition from avian to mammalian phenotypes. This project will bring together a unique team of multidisciplinary investigators with expertise in viral ge-nomics, virology, and molecular evolution to test predictions from this model and understand the mechanismsthat govern the influenza transmission bottleneck. The project has 2 complementary, but distinct aims: Aim 1 will determine the nature of bottlenecks during transmission of a mammal-adapted 2009 H1N1pandemic (H1N1pdm) virus. Aim 2 will define how transmission bottlenecks impact selection as viruses encoding an avian-style HAadapt to mammalian hosts. If our hypothesis is correct, deep sequencing viruses causing human spillover infections to detectsignatures of selection during transmission would provide a novel and rapid means for assessing pan-demic risks.',\n",
       " \"Project SummaryMalaria is a major public health problem, with an estimated 198 million cases occurring world-wide in 2013.Effective strategies to reduce malaria transmission and disease have been highly successful leading to a 40%reduction in malaria cases in sub-Saharan Africa since 2000. It has been observed that infections clustergeographically and such clustering becomes more pronounced as transmission declines. The science ofidentifying `hotspots' of infection or foci of transmission is a growing area that promises to help targetinterventions more effectively. However, it has not been shown whether infected individuals in close physicalproximity (i.e. in the same household) are jointly infected due to simply living in a risky place, or because aninfected household member is a risk factor for nearby susceptible individuals. If the former, then targetinghotspots should focus on reducing environmental risk factors in the area around a hotpsot. If the latter, theninterventions to identify and treat `transmitters' will reduce transmission and reduce the incidence of newcases. Therefore, we need to understand the spatial scale of malaria transmission to predict the impact ofcommunity case detection and hotspot targeting. To shed light on this important issue, we propose twoscientific objectives. First, we will measure the genetic relatedness of infections within the same householdcompared to the relatedness of infections at further distances. We will determine whether this relationshipdiffers in fever `hotspots' (geographic clusters of high fever incidence) and fever `coldspots'. Parasite DNA fromdried blood spots collected from a moderate endemic study area in western Kenya (approximately 15 km by 28km encompassing more than 80 villages) will be sequenced at a moderately polymorphic gene using deepsequencing techniques. This will provide evidence for local, focal transmission if nearby infections are moreclosely related or will point to mixed transmission whereby infections only begin to differ as you reach thedistance of mosquito flying ranges. Our second objective is to trap malaria mosquito vectors and identifyinfected mosquitoes. We will determine the source of the mosquito's infection by sequencing parasites in themosquito salivary glands and comparing to parasite genotypes in humans. By doing so, we can find outwhether infections are being transmitted at a household scale or transmission is `well mixed' geographicallyand only limited by the range of the mosquito. If successful, this will be the first report of linking individualinfections in mosquitoes to their human source. The ability to track infections from human to mosquito andback again would allow us to understand the dynamics and scale of transmission in a way that has notpreviously been possible. We expect to scale up this approach to larger populations in subsequent studies.These results will provide insight into the expected impact of interventions designed to target hotspots.\",\n",
       " 'SummaryAs the Asia-Pacific aim to eliminate malaria from the entire region by 2030, a number of key challenges relatedto increasing strong variations in malaria transmission, the presence of a large reservoir of infected butasymptomatic individual and the development of resistance to frontline antimalarial treatment need to beconfronted. In addition, the predominance of P. vivax infections in the region results in the particular challengeof dealing with P. vivax hypnozoites and the relapsing infections the cause. The Asia-Pacific ICEMR project isproposing to conduct coordinated set of field and in-depth biological studies in 3 sites in Cambodia, PapuaNew Guinea and Thailand that span the range of transmission intensities currently found in the Asia-Pacificregions. In the Epidemiology Project spatio-temporal patterns of risk of malaria infection and disease will beinvestigate through a combination of large cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies that combineexcellent epidemiological study designs with state-of-the-art molecular detection and genotyping ofPlasmodium spp. infections and an assessment of host immune responses and their link to exposure andclinical protection. The information thus gained will be used to evaluate improved surveillance strategiesthrough an innovative combination of computer simulations and field application. The Transmission Projectwill use direct membrane feeding assay as a xenodiagnostic tool to determine the infective reservoir as eachsite and investigate host, parasite and host factors that contribute to sustaining endemic transmission at eachsite. In addition, we will study patterns of human-vector contact in low transmission settings by investigatinghuman antibodies to anopheline salivary protein as marker exposure to mosquito bites. A key question in bothstudies is how artemisinin and partner drug resistance affects parasite fitness both in chronic asymptomaticinfections and transmissibility. Finally, the P. vivax Relapse Project will specifically address the role ofrelapsing infections from long-lasting liver stages in the increased resilience of P. vivax against control andelimination. The conduct of these studies will use spatially explicit malaria transmission models, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based high-throughput genotyping methods and a range of high-throughput andfunctional assay of humoral immune responses that will be developed in 3 resource cores. Theseinterconnected, multi-disciplinary studies thus aim to identify and characterize critical steps in malariatransmission cycle and thereby gain a better understanding of parasite, host and vector factors that contributeto continued transmission in the context of intensive national malaria control and elimination programs. Thisknowledge will assist in the development of novel approaches to target residual transmission pockets.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTInfluenza virus is an airborne pathogen of major medical and public health significance worldwide that causesmillions of severe respiratory infections and an estimated 500,000 deaths each year. Despite decades ofresearch, basic questions remain about the routes of influenza transmission and the effect of viral,environmental, and host factors on transmission. This is especially true in tropical developing countries, wherethe relative contributions of the routes of transmission and the effect of climatic, environmental and social factorsdiffer from temperate settings. To undertake a detailed investigation of influenza transmission inNicaragua, we propose to conduct a prospective household cohort study. The research questionsaddressed build naturally on the findings of our two current studies, the Pediatric Influenza Cohort Study and theInfluenza Household Transmission Study in Managua, Nicaragua. The proposed study benefits from over 12years of collaboration between the study investigators at the University of Michigan and the Nicaraguan Ministryof Health and from the scientific capacity building in Managua that has resulted from numerous studies ondengue and influenza. Specifically, we will conduct a 5-year household cohort study designed to examineaerosol, droplet, and contact transmission of influenza in urban Nicaraguan households. Our centralhypothesis is that aerosol transmission is a major route of transmission of influenza in Nicaraguanhouseholds and that it occurs primarily at night when people crowd together to both socialize and sleep.We employ an innovative combination of rigorous epidemiological methodology, state-of-the-art technologies,and mathematical modeling that will enable investigation of influenza transmission in a novel context with anunprecedented level of detail. In Aim 1, we will investigate the potential for aerosol, droplet, direct contact, andindirect contact transmission using air and surface sampling. In Aim 2, we will examine the effect ofenvironmental factors including temperature, humidity, precipitation, and ventilation proxies collected at thehousehold level on the transmission of influenza. In Aim 3, we will determine the effect of host factors thatcondition exposure, including viral shedding and household crowding, sleeping conditions, and socialinteractions, measured using surveys, contact diaries, and sociometric badges, on the risk of influenzatransmission. In Aim 4, we will characterize the effect of host factors, such as pre-existing immunity, age andthe presence of chronic diseases, that influence whether an exposed person becomes infected and whether thatinfection progresses to disease or severe disease. This proposal addresses major gaps in knowledge oninfluenza transmission in tropical developing country settings. It is thus timely and well-poised to havesubstantial public health and scientific impact.',\n",
       " 'Human parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3 (HPIV1, 2, 3) are significant causes of severe pediatric respiratory tract disease worldwide. The HPIVs are enveloped, non-segmented, negative strand RNA viruses of the family Paramyxoviridae. The broad outlines of their biology and molecular genetics have been defined in extensive previous studies by this laboratory and others. The HPIV genome encodes a nucleoprotein N, phosphoprotein P, large polymerase protein L, internal matrix protein M, and fusion F and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase HN transmembrane surface glycoproteins. F and HN are the two viral neutralization antigens and the major protective antigens. In addition, the P gene encodes one or more accessory proteins (depending on the serotype) from one or more additional ORFs. Our present goal is to develop attenuated versions of HPIV1 and 3 that have been engineered to express the fusion F protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) from an added gene. This provides a bivalent vaccine candidate against the respective HPIV and RSV. Compared to RSV strains, the HPIVs replicate more efficiently in cell culture and do not share the physical instability of RSV strains. They also form spherical particles compared to the large filaments of RSV, making them more amenable to filtration and other steps in manufacture. These attributes would make RSV vaccines based on HPIV vectors much easier to manufacture, distribute, and use compared to attenuated RSV strains. These advantages may be essential for extending RSV vaccines to resource-challenged countries. Furthermore, in experimental animals, boosting responses to an earlier primary immunization with an attenuated RSV strain was more efficient using an HPIV/RSV vector as opposed to re-dosing with the attenuated RSV strain. Thus, HPIV/RSV vectors given subsequent (perhaps one year later) to an initial RSV immunization provide a unique way to achieve improved RSV boosts.We have been evaluating a number of parameters of vaccine vector design using, as proof of principle, an attenuated HPIV3 vaccine candidate called B/HPIV3. This virus consists of bovine PIV3 in which the F and HN genes have been replaced by those of HPIV3, yielding a chimeric virus that is attenuated in primates due to the bovine backbone, and which bears the neutralization and major protective F and HN antigens of HPIV3. Both the empty B/HPIV3 vector  and B/HPIV3 expressing the unmodified RSV F protein were well-tolerated in infants and young children. However, the latter construct was poorly immunogenic for RSV F, and analysis of specimens of shed vaccine in nasal washes showed that 50% of specimens had evidence of loss of expression of RSV F. Therefore, we have been working to increase the immunogenicity and stability of the RSV F insert.We previously found that insertion of the RSV F gene into the first (pre-N) and second (N-P) gene positions of B/HPIV3 yielded up to a 69-fold increase in expression of RSV F compared to insertion at gene position 6. Expression of RSV F was further enhanced 5-fold by codon-optimization. In addition, RSV F was stabilized in the pre-fusion (pre-F) conformation (the conformation that is the most efficient in inducing neutralizing antibodies) by an added disulfide bond (called DS, a mutation developed by VRC/NIAID). In the hamster model, the DS form of RSV F induced an increased quantity and quality of RSV-neutralizing serum antibodies and increased protection against wt RSV challenge, compared to native F. High quality antibodies are those that neutralize RSV in vitro in the absence of added complement: remarkably, expression of unmodified F did not induce detectable high quality antibodies in hamsters, whereas the DS form induced a substantial titer.We further modified RSV F by replacing its cytoplasmic tail (CT) domain, or its CT plus transmembrane (TM) domains (TMCT), with its counterparts from BPIV3 F. This resulted in RSV F being packaged in the B/HPIV3 particle with an efficiency similar to that of RSV particles. Enhanced packaging was substantially attenuating in hamsters (10- to 100-fold) and rhesus monkeys (100- to 1000-fold). Nonetheless, TMCT-directed packaging substantially increased the titers of high quality serum RSV-neutralizing antibodies induced in hamsters and rhesus monkeys. In rhesus monkeys, the combination of packaging plus DS pre-F stabilization resulted in a 30-fold increase in serum RSV-neutralizing titers in the absence of added complement, respectively, compared to pre-F stabilization alone, despite the much-lower replication due to attenuation by TMCT.In the present report, the pre-F conformation was further stabilized by adding cavity-filling mutations to the DS form of F, resulting in the DS-Cav1 form (developed by VRC/NIAID). Also, codon-usage was modified to have a lower content of CpG dinucleotides, which can be inducers of innate immunity. This DS-Cav1 F ORF was evaluated in rB/HPIV3 in three forms: (i) DS-Cav1 ectodomain lacking the TMCT domains  which would result in its secretion; (ii) DS-Cav1 without the TMCT packaging signal, and (iii) DS-Cav1 with the TMCT packaging signal. The DS-Cav1 ectodomain was efficiently secreted but was poorly immunogenic. Full-length DS-Cav1, with or without the vector-specific TMCT packaging signals, induced high titers of pre-F specific antibodies in hamsters and improved quality of RSV-neutralizing serum antibodies, compared to previous versions of RSV F. Codon-optimized RSV F containing fewer CpG dinucleotides had higher F expression, replicated slightly more efficiently in vivo, and was more immunogenic in hamsters as assessed by titers of high-quality RSV-neutralizing serum antibodies and protective efficacy against RSV challenge. Analysis of innate immune responses to the vectors in cell culture indicated that the reduced CpG content resulted in reduced type I and III interferon responses and a modest increase in vector replication. The combination of DS-Cav1 pre-F stabilization, optimized codon-usage, reduced CpG content, and vector packaging significantly improved vector immunogenicity and protective efficacy against RSV. This provides an improved HPIV3-vectored RSV vaccine candidate that will be manufactured into clinical trial maternal for pediatric clinical evaluation.The genetic stability of the RSV F insert in the B/HPIV3 vector was evaluated at several stages during optimization by a double-immunostaining plaque assay designed to detect expression of both RSV F and vector proteins. Surprisingly, the stability of RSV F expression typically was very high and usually was not affected by enhanced expression, or pre-F stabilization, or packaging via TMCT. An occasional preparation was found to have some loss of expression of RSV F, but this could simply be discarded and replaced by a replicate preparation.As noted, packaging the RSV F protein into the B/HPV3 vector increased its level of attenuation in rhesus monkeys 100- to 1000-fold, while providing increased quantity and quality of serum RSV-neutralizing antibodies. However, this reduction in replication is not needed for safety, since the B/HPIV3 vector already was satisfactorily attenuated on its own, and the further 100- to 1000-fold reduction in replication may unnecessarily reduce immunogenicity due to reduced antigen expression. Therefore, we also are inserting the TMCT version of RSV F into other backbones that are less restricted than B/HPIV3, and therefore should yield a construct that is not unnecessarily over-restricted for replication and therefore should be more immunogenic.',\n",
       " 'The goal of this agreement is to identify the key protective epitopes and to develop new tools to measure virus neutralization and antibody affinity for RSV.  In addition, antibody repertoires, antibody isotype and antibody affinity against different RSV antigens following RSV infections (different age cohorts) will be measured and vaccinations with different vaccine platforms will be evaluated. Rapid neutralization assays will be developed for evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary and Relevance Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of serious lower respiratory tract infectionsand hospitalization in infants, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Natural infection does notinduce durable protective immunity to the virus and multiple reinfections can occur even within the same year.To date, there is as yet no effective vaccine or treatment. We have developed novel RSV-virus-like particle(VLP) vaccine candidates composed of Newcastle Disease Virus nucleoprotein and membrane proteins thatexpress RSV F and G glycoproteins ectodomains fused with NDV glycoprotein cytoplasmic domains. This VLPinduces long-lived protective neutralizing antibody responses and memory B cells in mice when given once inthe absence of adjuvant. Mice challenged with RSV post immunization clear the virus and do not displayenhanced pulmonary disease. Because adjuvant is not required for this protective immune response, wepropose that the VLP directly stimulates the innate immune system, such as TLRs or MAV. We will investigatethis possibility by using mutant mouse models deficient in single components of the innate immune system andthe impact on development of durable protective immunity. These studies will provide essential information forthe future development of our vaccine candidate and define the most efficacious TLR agonists for clinicaltesting',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT This proposal will characterize the influence of tick gut microbiota on the ability of Borreliaburgdorferi, the Lyme disease agent, to be transmitted from ticks to the vertebrate host. Ourrecent work (Narasimhan et al, Cell Host Microbe 15:58-71, 2014) demonstrated that tick gut microbiotamodulate B. burgdorferi colonization of Ixodes scapularis. Our preliminary data suggest that normalgut microbiota facilitate efficient B. burgdorferi transmission to the mammalian host. This is acritical event in the context of human Lyme disease and understanding how tick gut microbiota influenceBorrelia transmission to the mammalian host will reveal new ways to prevent Lyme disease transmission. In Aim 1 we will characterize and determine tick gut bacterial profiles that are associated withdecreased B. burgdorferi transmission to the vertebrate host. Further, we will also begin to assess themicrobial compositions of nymphal ticks obtained from endemic regions in Connecticut to co-relate ourobservations on lab-reared ticks. Application of this knowledge to field studies in future efforts mightprovide new predictors/biomarkers of transmission risk in specific geographic areas. In Aim 2 we will perform a transcriptome analysis of the tick gut to describe the molecularpathways of the tick that are influenced by gut microbiota during B. burgdorferi transmission. With afocus on up to 10 genes that are significantly altered by gut microbiota we will determine their functionalconsequence on B. burgdorferi transmission. Potential vaccine targets to impair Borrelia transmissionmay be identified from this functional analysis. Finally, we will determine if dysbiosis might modulate the expression profiles of Borrelial virulencegenes, and additionally influence spirochete transmission to the host. We will focus on the lipoproteinencoding virulence genes of B. burgdorferi and unravel a new understanding of how B. burgdorferisenses the tick gut environment to regulate the expression of virulence genes. This research effort will move the field beyond a descriptive understanding of tick gut microbiota,and unfold a mechanistic understanding of the influence of tick gut bacteria on tick-pathogen interactionsin particular, and on vector-pathogen interactions in general. Tick gut microbiota provides a newvantage point to understand the biology of B. burgdorferi transmission to mice and to developnew paradigms to explore the factors that contribute to the spread of Lyme disease.',\n",
       " 'This past year we have made significant discoveries for each of these objectives summarized below. Identify human viruses (in addition to PV, CVB3 and rhinovirus) that traffic by bloc transmission both in vitro and in vivo. (Marianita Santiana, Sourish Ghosh, Brian Ho)We have discovered that two important human enteric viruses, rotavirus and norovirus, both exit cells as populations using vesicles. We have found that rotavirus vesicles are derived from the plasma membrane and norovirus vesicles are derived from multivesicular bodies. Furthermore, we developed methods to look for whether these two viruses can be transmitted in vivo inside vesicles. With help from our collaborators (Kim Green, Wendy Henderson, Linda Saif) we obtained rotavirus and norovirus infected fecal samples and demonstrated that both viruses are present inside phosphatidylserine-enriched vesicles in fecal samples. We also obtained fecal samples from Astrovirus and Parvovirus infected individuals (thorugh our collaborator David Wang) and developed methods to isolate putative astro or parvo virus carrying fecal vesicles. We are currently analyzing the contents of the vesicles pulled down to determine if they carry these viruses. In addition we are pulling down fecal vesicles from unknown samples and doing RNA and DNA sequencing to identify additional viruses that are being trafficked inside vesicles in feces. Determine the mechanisms by which identified viruses are trafficked out of cells as populations both in vitro and in vivo. (Yael Mutsafi Benhalevy, Teegan Dellibovi-Ragheb)We have identified some of the autophagy machinery being exploited for poliovirus exit in secretory autophagosomes as well as a potential viral protein sequence that is being targeted by the host autophagy machinery to capture poliovirus particles. We have also discovered a novel pathway for coronavirus exit from cells. Contrary to literature that states that these viruses ( SARS, MERS etc) leave cells via the secretory pathway, we have found instead that these viruses are secreted from cells by the fusion with the plasma membrane of an endoplasmic reticulum- late endosome hybrid compartment. Determine the impact, in terms of viral yield, virulence and viral genetic diversity, of viral population carrying vesicles in inter-organismal transmission. (Sourish Ghosh, Marianita Santiana)This past year we have developed an in vivo mouse model system to interrogate the role of vesicles in rotavirus transmission. We have shown that vesicles carrying murine rotavirus are stable and can transmit infection through the oral-fecal route (much like in humans). Moreover we have found that this type of transmission, compared to free rotavirus transmission, results in significantly more severe clinical symptoms, earlier clinical symptom onset, longer disease period and much greater transmission to littermates. We have also begun to examine which tissues are preferentially targeted by viruses carrying populations, what their targeting may mean for the clinical severity observed. We will also begin examining the viral genome diversity in an organism that has been infected by populations as opposed to free particles. Determine the differences, if any, in the host immune responses (innate and adaptive) when infected by bloc transmission versus single particle transmission. (Ying-Han Chen, Sourish Ghosh, Yakey Yaffe)We have found profound differences in the innate and adaptive immune response of cells and organisms respectively to infection by bloc transmission. In summary when cells are infected with high multiplicities of viral genomes we find that they can no longer distinguish among entering non-self RNA and self RNA molecules, leading to an overall suppression of the innate immune response. This is a completely unexpected finding and upends much of what we know about innate immune responses and self/non-self RNA recognition. In addition, we find profound differences in the adaptive immune responses, specifically the mucosal immune response. This coming FY we will investigate if the innate immune behavior (suppression) is linked to the mucosal immune behavior (suppression).',\n",
       " 'PROJECT ABSTRACT Retroviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that cause cancers and immunodeficiency diseases inhumans and animals. Our laboratory studies Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), an avian retrovirus that causes solidtumors in domesticated fowl, as a model for dissecting the molecular underpinnings of retroviral assembly. Ourdiscovery that the RSV structural protein Gag transiently travels through the nucleus in a Crm1-dependentfashion challenged the traditional view of retroviral assembly. Treatment with a Crm1 inhibitor or mutation ofthe nuclear export signal (NES) effectively traps RSV Gag in the nucleus, allowing us to further study the roleof Gag in the nucleus. Recent studies have revealed additional retroviral Gag proteins that undergo nuclearlocalization, suggesting there may be common functions of Gag within the nucleus. Retroviruses are unique in that they package two copies of their genome as non-covalently linkedgenomic RNA dimers. Genome dimerization is facilitated by cis-acting sequences located in the 5’UTR of theviral RNA. Dimerization of the genome is conserved in orthoretroviruses and is required for viral replication.Despite its critical importance in replication, the mechanisms underlying genome dimerization within infectedcells remains poorly understood. RSV affords a unique opportunity to investigate genome dimerization usingour extensive toolbox of genetic, biochemical and imaging methods because we can readily manipulate thesubcellular localization of Gag with our well-characterized collection of viral mutants. In recent work, we havedeveloped methods to visualize fluorophore-tagged RSV Gag proteins co-localized with viral genomic RNA inthe cell. Our experiments suggest nuclear trafficking of Gag is required for the efficient packaging of retroviralgenomic RNA. This proposal thus aims to understand the mechanism governing genome dimerization in RSV,and we will test the hypothesis that nuclear trafficking of Gag plays a role in facilitating genome dimerization. In these studies, we will utilize the MS2 and Bgl RNA labeling system to visualize two distinct viral RNApopulations to examine genome dimerization. This approach will allow us to determine the subcellular locationof dimerization; whether there is preferential formation of heterodimers, which contain two genetically distinctviral genomes, or homodimers, composed of two identical viral genomes; and whether dimerization occurs in aco-transcriptional manner. We will also examine the role of nuclear Gag in genome dimerization and determinewhether RSV Gag initially binds monomers or dimers. Studies that express the viral RNA and Gag in trans willinvestigate whether Gag facilitates genome dimerization within different compartments of the cell. The findingsfrom this proposal will greatly contribute to the understanding of this critical step in the replication cycle andmay provide support for future anti-retroviral therapeutics. Overall, this program is designed to provide acomprehensive experience consisting of opportunities in laboratory-based research, scientific careerdevelopment, educational seminars, and mentoring to advance physician-scientist training.',\n",
       " 'Hemocytes synthesize components of the mosquito complement-like system and are major players of the priming response. However, it is not clear how they enhance antiplasmodial immunity.  The fate of mosquito hemocytes following infection with Plasmodium was investigated by labeling these cells in vivo.  We found that midgut nitration triggers the local release of hemocyte-derived microvesicles (HdMv) into the basal labyrinth of the midgut. Several different strategies, such as gene silencing, immune priming or systemic injection of polystyrene beads were used to either enhance or reduce HdMv release. We provide direct experimental evidence that contact of hemocytes with the nitrated midgut basal surface triggers HdMv release, and that this response is necessary for effective activation of mosquito complement. Our studies suggest that hemocyte-derived microvesicles deliver some critical factor(s) that promote activation of thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1), a key effector of the mosquito antiplasmodial immunity.  This work was published in Science Immunology.Recent experiments revealed that midgut epithelial cells produce prostaglandins when they come in direct contact with bacteria from the gut microbiota, and that this response in necessary to establish immune priming.  We found that prostaglandin release attracts hemocytes to the basal surface of the midgut and increases their motility as they patrol this interphase.  We have established chemotaxis assays to evaluate the migration of hemocyte-like Sua 5.1 cells in response to prostaglandins.  Insects also do not have cyclooxygenases, the enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of prostaglandins in vertebrates.  We are currently screening several heme peroxidases based on their expression pattern and on the effect silencing expression by dsRNA injections on prostaglandin synthesis. We have also shown that hemocyte-derived-microvesicles (HdMv) promote complement activation. An in vitro system to induce microvesicle release by Sua 5.1 cells, as they come in contact with a nitrated extracellular matrix has been established. HdMv will be purified from this culture system and their protein cargo will be determined by proteomic analysis.  The surface receptor that allows Sua 5.1 cells to respond to a nitrated surface will also be characterized using far-western blots, immobilizing cell membranes under denaturing non-reducing conditions and probing for binding of nitrated BSA with an anti-nitrotyrosine monoclonal antibody.The African (NF54) and the New World (7G8) strains differ drastically in their ability to evade the immune system of A. gambiae L35 refractory mosquitoes.  Immune evasion is mediated by Pfs47, but there are only four amino acid differences between the Pfs47 protein in the NF54 and 7G8 strains. Our studies indicate that single amino acid replacements in any of the four amino acids in Pfs47 that differ between the P. falciparum NF54 and 7G8 strains, completely disrupts the ability of NF54 parasites to hide from the mosquito immune system. One of these amino acid replacements had the opposite effect on A. albimanus mosquitoes, and enhanced infection.  We conclude that malaria transmission involves a complex interplay between the genetic background of the parasite and the mosquito and that Pfs47 is critical in these interactions, as it mediates Plasmodium immune evasion through molecular interactions that need to be precise in some parasite/vector combinations, such as the NF54 line with the A. gambiae L35 strain. This work was published in PlosOne.The potential of Pfs47 as a transmission blocking vaccine target was explored.  We were able to produced full-length recombinant Pfs47 in E. coli and developed an in-column refolding and purification protocol.  The protein is immunogenic and mouse polyclonal antibodies recognize Pfs47 in the membrane of female gametocytes.  We generated 14 monoclonal antibodies, but none of them had strong transmission blocking activity.  We found that all of them bound to either domain 1 (D1) or domain 3 (D3), but none of them recognized the D2-domain.  The D2-domain could not be expressed alone as it was toxic to all systems tested, but when we removed the disulfide bond in the D2-loop, by replacing the two cysteines by alanines, we were able to obtain large amounts of immunogenic recombinant protein in E. coli.  Polyclonal antibodies to the D2-domain have strong transmission blocking activity.  We generated six new monoclonal antibodies to the D2 domain, and mapped the target regions that confers strong transmission blocking activity (98-99%). We are currently testing different constructs in collaboration with Drs. Patrick Duffy and Robert Seder to design the ideal antigen for an effective transmission blocking vaccine. We are currently investigating the mechanism of action of the vaccine.  Wolbachia is an intracellular bacteria that induces refractoriness to infection with arboviruses in A. aegypti mosquitoes. We identified a strain of Wolbachia infecting natural populations of A. gambiae s.l. from Mali. The presence of Wolbachia was detected by PCR using Wolbachia-specific 16S ribosomal gene primers and confirmed by sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this Wolbachia strain in A. gambiae s.l. is a sister group to a strain previously identified in the flea Ctenocephalides sp., supporting acquisition by horizontal transfer.  In field-collected mosquitoes, significantly lower Wolbachia levels were observed in Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes when compared to uninfected controls.  To further investigate these interactions, a laboratory colony of Wolbachia-infected A. gambiae M form (A. colluzzii) was established and females were infected with P. falciparum (NF54). We found that mosquitoes carrying high levels of Wolbachia were less likely to carry Plasmodium sporozites. The effect of Wolbachia on the oocyst stage is under evaluation.  Malaria is endemic in the American continent, and the Amazonian rainforest is the region with the highest risk of transmission.  The lack of suitable experimental models to infect malaria vectors from the Americas has limited the progress to understand the biology of transmission in this region.  A systematic analysis of compatibility of several different Plasmodium parasite species will be used to establish a robust experimental model of malaria transmission by anopheline mosquitoes from South America. We found that Anopheles aquasalis, a major vector in coastal areas of South America, is highly refractory to infection with two strains of Plasmodium falciparum (NF54 and 7G8) and with Plasmodium berghei (mouse malaria), even when the microbiota was eliminated with antibiotics and oxidative stress was reduced by oral administration of uric acid.  In contrast, An. aquasalis females are susceptible to infection with another murine parasite, Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis N67 (PyN67).  Anopheles albimanus, one of the main malaria vectors in Central America, Southern Mexico and the Caribbean, was more susceptible to infection with PyN67 than An. aquasalis, even in the absence of any pre-treatment.  Disruption of the complement-like system in Anopheles albimanus significantly enhanced PyN67 infection, indicating that the mosquito immune system is mounting an effective antiplasmodial response. Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis has the ability to infect a broad range of anophelines, and is an excellent model to study malaria transmission by South American vectors.  This work was published in PlosOne.',\n",
       " 'SummaryDespite having reduced malaria transmission to historically low level, in many Asia-Pacific countries endemicareas transmission continues and common vector control tools seem not able to interrupt transmission. Thereasons for the resilience of malaria transmission are on unclear but are likely to involve not only parasite butalso host and vector factors. At low transmission, asymptomatic infections account for up to 90% of infectionsand it they are able to transmit efficiently they could be a key component of the infectious reservoir. The onlyway to accurately ascertain if an infection can transmit is to feed the blood to mosquitoes and determine rateand density of infections of the mosquito midgut. Such xenodiagnostic studies are severely lacking, inparticular in predominantly P. vivax endemic area. We are now proposing to conduct an in-depth dissection ofthe contribution of host, parasite and vector factors to maintaining malaria transmission by conducting a setstudies that combine assessment of the infectivity of well characterized field samples using direct membranefeeding (DFMA) with in-depth laboratory studies in 3 sites with substantially different transmission scenarios.Initially we will investigate the relative infectivity of asymptomatic and symptomatic infections establish theassociation of parasite and gametocytes density with infectivity and study effect of transmission blockingimmunity, vector microbiome and type parasite for gene associated with evasion of mosquito immuneresponses and markers of artemisinin and partner drugs resistance to determine their effect on transmissionpotential. As parasite and gametocyte fluctuate over time, so may their infectivity. We will therefore determinethe temporal variation in infectivity an in-depth cohort study in PNG, where asymptomatic carriers will befollowed for 3 weeks and mosquitoes fed every 3-4 days. Addition, we will determine proportion of pre- andpost-treatment infectivity in in artemisinin-resistant and sensitive symptomatic P. falciparum. Together with ourlarge epidemiological datasets (see Project 1), this will allow us not only clarify the contribution ofasymptomatic infections to transmission but also resistance may come with a transmission associated fitnesscost, which may slow down the spread of resistance. Both human and vector behavior may limit human-vectorcontact in the Asia-Pacific, where vectors are frequently / predominantly outdoor biting, leading to transmissionaway from people’s dwelling. The low biting rate and unclear location of human-vector contact makes it difficultto identify its determinants. We will we study patterns of human vector contact by determining the presence ofantibodies against salivary gland protein antibodies proteins from An. dirus. An. minimus and An. Farauti insamples from cross-sectional and cohort studies in Project 1. By providing an in-depth understanding of thetransmission characteristics at each of our sites, the proposed studies will not only contribute to developingbiologically accurate transmission models but will help us design better methods to track and eliminatetransmission even in hard to track populations such asymptomatic carriers.',\n",
       " 'Studies on asexual stage immunity to P. falciparum 1.) Evaluate the merozoite antigen PfRH5 as a vaccine candidate. Our collaborators at Oxford University (Dr. Simon Draper et al.) are pursuing this protein as a vaccine candidate and  we have contributed to various pre-clinical studies using our standardized growth-inhibition assay (GIA). One clinical trial using immunization with recombinant viruses has already been conducted but the immunogenicity was not sufficient to justify a parasite challenge. However, a second clinical trial using recombinant protein is in progress and our immunogenicity results to date will likely support a challenge infection late in 2017. 2.)In addition, we are initiating a more detailed study of immune responses in field sites to PfRH5 as well as other molecules associated as part of an invasion complex with this molecule - PfCyRPA, PfRIPr, etc.3.) Investigate other targets of merozoite immunity - AMA1While AMA1 is a prominent vaccine candidate, it has two issues:1) antigenic polymorphism so that antibody responses tend to be strain-specific and 2) lack of protection in human clinical trials. We have collaborated with LMVR investigators (Dr. Louis Miller) to show that using AMA1 in conjunction with its partner protein RON2 produces antibodies with greater activity in the GIA assay. This complex is required for triggering junction formation between the merozoite and the red cell surface. 4.) Studies of immunity to malaria in Kenieroba, Mali. Our 4-year investigation of the acquisition of immunity to malaria in Malian children represents perhaps the most detailed longitudinal study of malaria in African children that has been conducted. Antisera collected in this 4-year study continue to be used to evaluate other blood-stage vaccine candidates. For example, with Dr. Takafumi Tsuboi we have identified LSA-3 as a possible vaccine candidate based on antibody responses to a large array of blood-stage proteins produced in a wheat germ expression system.5.) We continue to work with Drs. Amy Bei and Dyann Wirth (Harvard University), who are studying changes in frequency of different P.falciparum clones over time in Senegal. We have collaborated in examining the influence of human immune responses on the changes in clonal parasite patterns, particularly related to the observation of parasites with common genetic signatures (CGS). Initial studies addressed the possibility that the human antibody responses affected the selection and persistence of parasite clones with CGS. More advanced studies are in progress.6.) We are also collaborating with Oxford University on a major EU-funded project to develop a 3-stage multi-component vaccine for P. falciparum.Studies on parasite sexual stages and transmission blocking vaccine candidates:1.) Develop quantitative methodology for analysis of the standard mosquito membrane feeding assay (SMFA) to evaluate transmission blocking activity. The gold standard assay to evaluate the ability of antibodies to block transmission to mosquitoes is the SMFA, and we have performed an in depth study of this assay to define its characteristics in order to have confidence in assessing potential transmission blocking vaccine (TBV) candidates. We have shown that the SMFA is quite reproducible at high concentrations of antibody but highly variable at low concentrations, and we have worked with the Biostatistics group at NIAID to develop a statistical model of the assay. Recently we have tested a modified model of the assay to show for the first time that we can predict the impact of a specific antibody on the reduction of P. falciparum parasite prevalence in mosquitoes based on the reduction in oocysts in an SMFA and the number of oocysts in control mosquitoes. Reduction in malaria prevalence in mosquitoes by an antibody is key to reducing transmission in the field. 2.) Search for and evaluate new possible transmission blocking vaccine candidates. Using SMFA we have evaluated a number of potential transmission blocking vaccine candidates. In collaboration with colleagues at Oxford University we have produced and tested a number of known and unknown sexual stage proteins from P. falciparum. Sera from immunized mice have been evaluated by SMFA but none have shown high levels of oocyst inhibition. Further we have tested antibodies produced by collaborators to large numbers of other sexual stage and mosquito vaccine candidates to compare their activity.3.) Construction and evaluation of human/humanized monoclonal antibodies (mabs) to several sexual stage parasite proteins. We are currently comparing a number of mabs to Pfs25 and other candidates as a foundation for human clinical trials. Passive administration of these antibodies will allow evaluation of transmission blocking in vivo and might eventually be used in elimination campaigns. We are comparing them in SMFA, mapping their epitopes, and determining their binding properties.4.) We have initiated studies to examine the differentiation pattern of P. falciparum gametocytes in culture using RNASeq. We have obtained data on RNA transcription during 2- weeks of differentiation and we are analyzing the data to identify better markers of early and late stage gametocyte development. 5.)In addition, we are conducting a series of experiments to determine what serum-derived factors are necessary for successful differentiation of gametocytes so that robust numbers of oocysts can be obtained after mosquito infection. Mass spectrometry of  good  and  bad  sera have shown consistent differences between them (M Llinas collaboration).Field studies of malaria transmission in Mali1.) We have assessed the presence of asexual and sexual stage parasites in residents of Kenieroba, Mali throughout the year. In the spring of 2013 we initiated a new study (NIH 13-I-N107) to address the limited information on transmission in malaria endemic areas, and in 2014 we completed the field aspect of this study. Volunteers representing all age groups were finger pricked twice per month for 1 year to collect DNA and RNA. We previously completed analysis of over 10,000 samples of parasite DNA on filter paper. In November, 2013 (wet season), P. falciparum prevalence in the cohort was 37.0%, and in May of 2014 (dry season), the prevalence dropped to 10.0%. We also analyzed the longitudinal prevalence of the cohort; we observed that the 9-16 years old age group had the highest median longitudinal prevalence compared to the other age groups, and males had a higher median than females (22.0%). 2.)We showed for the first time that increasing P.falciparum longitudinal prevalence throughout the year was associated with decreasing risk of clinical malaria. This suggests that those with persistent parasite carriage acquire stronger protective immunity against clinical malaria.3.) We added a new barcoding procedure based on a methodology developed at Harvard University to determine how many different clones of parasites an individual was carrying. This allowed us to show that at least 70% of infections were polygenomic, so that most people in the population are carrying more than one parasite clone at any given time. Moreover, this distribution held during both the wet and dry seasons of the year.4.) Using the RNA collections from the same study, we used a qRT-PCR procedure to identify Pfs25 mRNA specific for gametocytes. We completed RNA analysis to determine who is carrying gametocytes. Interestingly, even though they may not be visible by microscopy, more than 80% of people with parasites also have detectable gametocytes by molecular criteria. This shows that no one group can be uniquely targeted for interventions to reduce transmission.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) inchildren, elderly and immunocompromised hosts, for which no effective treatment or vaccine is available.Children who develop RSV-induced bronchiolitis are also at increased risk for recurrent wheezing anddevelopment of asthma in later life. Although the pathogenesis of RSV-induced disease remains a matter ofintense scientific debate, increasing evidence from experimental models and studies in naturally acquiredinfections suggest that severe LRTIs are indeed associated with increased viral “load” and delayed viralclearance due to an innate immune response that fails to restrict viral replication, yet causing inflammation andtissue damage. The endogenously-generated gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is implicated in a varietyof inflammatory and vascular disorders, associated with both pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling. Recently,our group has gathered important new data, reagents and animals models that demonstrate a key role of H2Sin mediating antiviral and anti-inflammatory responses in the lung. In particular, we have shown that H2Spotently inhibits viral replication, exerts anti-inflammatory activity, and controls airway hyperresponsiveness inRSV-infected mice. At the cellular level, we have shown that RSV is capable of inhibiting the expression ofcystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), the key enzyme that generates H2S is the lung, reducing the ability to generatecellular H2S. We propose that dysregulation of the H2S pathway affects host antiviral response and plays acritical role in the pathogenesis of severe RSV infections. Our findings indicate an important cross-talk betweenH2S and the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-dependent pathways, which control the cellularredox balance, each of them exerting a positive influence on the other, and both of them being downregulatedin the course of RSV infection. Thus, in this project, we will test the central hypothesis that inhibition ofcytoprotective H2S generation, due to decreased NRF2-dependent gene transcription, leads to clinicalmanifestations of RSV infection. We will employ a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to test thishypothesis, by the use of cells and mice genetically deficient in either NRF2 or H2S generating enzymes, andthe access to our ongoing cohort of infants and young children with primary RSV infections. This project willelucidate innate pathways by which respiratory viruses modulate lung disease, with strong implications fordeveloping novel antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies for RSV-induced LRTI and possiblylong-term consequences, such as recurrent wheezing or asthma. Our long-standing clinical and researchexpertise in the area of pathogenesis of viral bronchiolitis and RSV infections, strong preliminary data, andUTMB's outstanding resources in the area of lung disease make us ideally suited to pursue this innovativeproject.\",\n",
       " 'The broad, long-term objective of this project is to guide malaria elimination strategies in Amazonia taking intoaccount human, environmental, and biological features that combine to maintain hypoendemic malaria in theregion. The complexity of Amazonian malaria is augmented by intense human movement related to work andsocial interactions, which combined with asymptomatic infections lead to “silent” reservoirs of malaria parasitesmoving across space and time. Over the past ICEMR project period, population-based longitudinal cohortstudies in Brazil and Peru have demonstrated complex patterns of malaria transmission in epidemiologicallycontrasting sites (e.g., increasing transmission vs. disappearing malaria). This new Project will continuelongitudinal studies to delineate a fine level of malaria transmission and endemicity complexity in these andnew sites. This Project is based on the primary hypothesis (as is the entire Amazonia ICEMR program)that asymptomatic, subpatent parasitemia drive ongoing hypoendemic malaria. Residual malaria (dueto outdoor-biting Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes potentially related to anthropogenically-drivenchanging vector behaviors and genetics, Project 2) and emerging, complex patterns of malariareintroductions has made studying alternative approaches to malaria elimination a critical issue. In thisproject we seek to understand the patterns and determinants of two contrasting malaria epidemiologicalsettings in the Amazon: residual malaria with continuing hypoendemicity, and foci of high transmission. Thesesettings have different local ecologies (riverine, highway and urban areas) and human behavior (e.g., bednetuse, occupation, mobility). In Aim 1, we will gather data to calculate and interpret local indices of transmission,and to comprehensively identify local determinants of malaria transmission. Aim 1 integrates all three Projectsof the ICEMR by identifying and characterizing the context of malaria cases, and referring symptomatic andasymptomatic patients to Project 2 to guide mosquito population characterization and transmission biologystudies, and to Project 3 for immunological experiments, respectively. In Aim 2 comprehensive molecularepidemiological approaches and population genetics will be used to identify temporal population changes in P.vivax and P. falciparum, to detect reintroductions and parasite population replacements, and to estimateparasite population complexity at baseline and potentially after interventions. Aim 3, also integrating all threeICEMR projects, will model the dynamics of malaria transmission, simulate the optimal intervention packagesto reduce malaria in epidemiologically contrasting settings, explicitly accounting for ecological heterogeneityand differences in human socio-demographics. This Project will contribute new solutions to ongoing andemerging malaria challenges in Amazonia. The comprehensive molecular and epidemiological data sets fromthis Project, integrated with Project 2, studies of vector ecology and transmission biology, and with Project 3,immunology of asymptomatic malaria, will provide a roadmap for new approaches to malaria elimination.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT 2PROJECT SUMMARY Impact of Environmental Modifications on Vector Ecologyand Transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax MalariaMost of the population in sub-Saharan Africa faces the constant threat of famine. Approachesto the famine problem need to address the underlying conditions that make food shortagesendemic. Construction of dams and irrigated agricultural farms has been widely recognizedas a key solution to promoting food security and alleviating poverty. A large number of dams,microdams and irrigated farms have been developed in Africa in the past decade, and manyare under construction or being planned. These water resource development projects areanticipated to cause major changes in the ecology of malaria vectors. How changes to thevector ecology alter transmission dynamics is however not clear. New interventions that caneffectively suppress malaria transmission while simultaneously increasing agriculturalproductivity are urgently needed. The central objective of this project is to examine theimpact of environmental modifications from water resource development projects onvector ecology and malaria transmission in Kenya and Ethiopia. The centralhypothesis is that malaria transmission dynamics is strongly influenced byenvironmental modifications from water resource development projects. These waterresource development projects create more stable and productive breeding sites anddisrupt transmission. As a result, seasonality, spatial distribution, vector communitystructure, and vector competence get altered. We propose four specific aims: 1) assessthe impact of environmental modifications from water resource development projects onvector bionomics and malaria transmission dynamics, 2) determine the effects ofenvironmental modifications on vector population genetics and vector competence, 3)evaluate the impact of next-generation nets recently introduced as a part of the public healthprogram, on malaria incidence and vector insecticide resistance under differentenvironmental conditions, and 4) model the cost-effectiveness of novel integrated vectormanagement approaches suitable to areas with extensive environmental modifications. Theproject will significantly enhance our understanding of the impact of environmentalmodifications on malaria vector ecology and the underlying ecological and geneticmechanisms for altered transmission. Through modeling of cost-effectiveness of newintegrated vector intervention approaches, this project will provide important information thatcan guide future field trial design and inform policy makers of new malaria controlapproaches. Malaria outdoor transmission, pyrethroid resistance, and environmentalmodifications are presently of great concern and urgent issues that need to beaddressed globally. Thus, our results can have far reaching and broad implications onmalaria prevention and control.',\n",
       " 'The major goal of this program is to further develop and translate recent discoveries in biology ofrespiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an important pathogen that infects an estimated 64 million peopleand causes ~200, 000 deaths globally every year. In the US, RSV causes >11,000 deaths ofelderly annually. There is no effective treatment or vaccine against RSV infection. Currently, onlyhigh-risk infants receive antibody-based prophylaxis, which is expensive and moderately effectivein reducing hospitalization. Therefore, a broadly applicable, effective and inexpensive approach toprevent or treat RSV-bronchiolitis or -pneumonia remains an urgent unmet need.This proposal to develop and test a novel prophylaxis and/or therapy against RSV infection wasinspired by the following discoveries. i) A platform of phospholipid micellar nanoparticles (PMN)was developed, which when given intranasally delivers payload predominantly to the lung. ii) Adecoy short heptad repeat (HR)2 peptide was identified, which effectively inhibits the RSV-cellfusion. iii) Human mesenchymal cells were found to be highly susceptible to RSV. The latter aidedin establishing a novel 3D scaffold for anti-RSV drug screens, which consisted of creating a nakedmouse lung scaffold (nMLS) by decellularization followed by recellularization of the nMLS withdesired human cells, such as hMSCs and epithelial cells and then infecting the cells in scaffoldwith RSV. iv) A robust immunocompromised mouse model was created by combiningcyclophosphamide treatment with infection by a highly mucogenic strain, RSV-L19F. Thesedevelopments have led to the hypothesis that a RSV-targeted PMN (RTPMN), combining HR2Danti-fusion peptide, and plasmid encoded siRNAs against RSV-NS1 and/or RSV-P gene canprovide a safe, effective and inexpensive anti-RSV prophylaxis and/or therapy. Three specific aims(SAs) will test these hypotheses. In SA#1, multifunctional and smart RTPMNs will be synthesized with plasmids encodingsiRNAs for RSV-NS1and RSV-P genes in the core and anti-fusion HR2D peptides on the surfaceand be characterized in vitro. In SA#2, RTPMNs will be examined for their biodistribution, pharm-toxand PK/PD properties. SA#3 will examine the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of RTPMN-HR2D-psiNS1-P against RSV infection in an in vitro 3D lung scaffold and in immunocompromisedmice to investigate the mechanism of action. The results of these highly innovative multidisciplinary translational studies are expected toincrease the understanding of RSV pathology in humanized mouse lung model and in a modelusing adult immunocompromised mice. A successful completion of preclinical formulation of anti-RSV PMN-based prophylactics and therapeutics is expected to pave the way to IND-driven studiesand clinical trials.',\n",
       " 'SUMMARYRespiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the single largest viral cause of pediatric bronchiolitis and pneumonia, witha high worldwide mortality, and there is no safe and effective vaccine. Ever since the encounter with vaccine-enhanced disease (VED) during a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccination trial in the 1960s, it has beenenormously challenging to impart both sufficient safety and efficacy in a single vaccine. For RSV-naïvechildren, live-attenuated vaccines are an important focus, because inactivated and subunit vaccines are poorat inducing cell-mediated immunity which contributes to VED. Moreover, live vaccines can induce broadsystemic and local immunity. Thus, for RSV-naïve individuals a live vaccine approach is an attractive option,provided the vaccine itself is sufficiently safe and cannot revert to a more aggressive phenotype.It has recently been recognized that the viral fusion (F) protein is unstable and readily shifts to the post-fusionconformation during purification or vaccine preparation. As a result, a large proportion of vaccine-inducedantibodies (Abs) target the post-fusion form, which is functionally obsolete. To avoid induction of anti- post-fusion F Abs, McLellan et al were able to genetically stabilize the pre-fusion form (referred to as FPRE), therebygreatly increasing neutralizing capacity of anti-F Abs, when given as a protein vaccine. However, subunitvaccines are deemed unsafe for the RSV-naïve target population. Thus, to protect RSV-naïve children there isa need to place the advantageous pre-fusion F concept in the context of a balanced immune response thatdoes not cause VED, which could be achieved by expressing FPRE from a live-attenuated virus.However, stabilization of FPRE renders it non-functional and a virus solely expressing FPRE is not viable. Wepreviously reported a baculovirus GP64 based complementation system that can overcome this problem, as ituniquely allows generation of infectious F-deleted or F-compromised viruses from cDNA in GP64-expressingcells. These GP64-pseudotyped viruses could be amplified to high titer and were significantly moretemperature stable than wildtype RSV. Due to replacement of functional F with trans-complemented GP64, theviruses are infectious but self-limited and cannot spread beyond initially infected cells, thus constituting anattractive live-attenuated platform. We have in vivo preliminary data using a similar single-round RSV vaccinethat suggests such vaccines are efficaceous.The goal of this proposal is to exploit the GP64 system to generate a live RSV which solely expresses the pre-fusion F form. Our hypothesis is that replacing the native, functional, F gene with a gene encoding a pre-fusionstabilized F in a live virus, will drive the anti-F response toward the pre-fusion F form, and will induce abalanced response that includes cell-mediated immunity and avoids VED. We will test this hypothesis throughtwo aims: 1) Generate and in vitro characterize a live-attenuated RSV lacking a functional F copy andexpressing instead a conformationally stabilized pre-fusion F; and 2) Characterize immune properties of RSVexpressing FPRE in vivo to assess safety and efficacy.If successful, the vaccine will exceed previous formulations in inducing a broadly efficaceous yet safe immuneresponse for the RSV-naïve target population.',\n",
       " 'Plague is a zoonosis that is present in wild rodent populations worldwide and is transmitted primarily by fleas. Yersinia pestis, the plague bacillus, is unique among the enteric group of gram-negative bacteria in having adopted an arthropod-borne route of transmission. Y. pestis has evolved in such a way as to be transmitted during the brief encounter between a feeding flea and a host. A transmissible infection primarily depends on the ability of Y. pestis to grow in the flea as a biofilm that is embedded in a complex extracellular matrix. Bacteria in the biofilm phenotype are deposited into the dermis together with flea saliva, elements which cannot be satisfactorily mimicked by needle-injection of Y. pestis from laboratory cultures. The objective of this project is to identify and determine the function of Y. pestis genes that mediate flea-borne transmission and the initial encounter with the host innate immune system at the infection site in the skin. We study the interaction of Y. pestis with its insect vector by using an artificial feeding apparatus to infect fleas with uniform doses of Y. pestis parent and mutant strains. We seek to identify Y. pestis genes that are required for the bacteria to infect the flea midgut and to produce a biofilm that blocks the flea foregut and that is required for efficient transmission. The strategy entails first identifying bacterial genes that are differentially expressed in the flea by gene expression analysis and other techniques. Specific mutations are then introduced into these genes, and the mutants tested for their ability to infect and block the flea vector. Identification of such transmission factors allows further studies into the molecular mechanisms of the bacterial infection of the flea vector. Detailed understanding of the interaction with the insect host may lead to novel strategies to interrupt the transmission cycle. We have also established in vitro methods to infect fleas and to monitor transmission dynamics of fleas over a one-month period following their infectious blood meal.  With this system we are able to compare the relative importance of the two modes of transmission and the relative vector competence of different flea species.  Our studies of flea vector competence and vectorial capacity will be useful to develop more realistic mathematical modeling of the epidemiology of plague transmission and the conditions that lead to plague epizootics.     During FY2017, we published a study on the comparative vector competence of the North American ground squirrel flea O. montana and the rat flea X. cheopis.  The work described new protocols to monitor and compare the infection and transmission dynamics of different flea vector species following a single standardized infectious blood meal.  Several recent papers cite that O. montana rarely if ever transmits by the biofilm-dependent mechanism, whereas X. cheopis is the vector par excellence by this mechanism. However, we demonstrated that both fleas are proficient at this transmission mechanism, thereby correcting a misconception.  Another aspect of this study was to compare the kinetics and temporal patterns of transmission during the early-phase and later phase transmission windows.  We found that the later, biofilm-dependent transmission mechanism was much more efficient than early-phase transmission.  We also published evidence for our proposed model for the early-phase transmission mechanism.  Early-phase transmission was long assumed to be mechanical, via contaminated mouthparts.  However, we proposed a regurgitative model based on the striking finding that dense bacterial aggregates associated with a rough, amorphous, brown-colored, waxy-looking material localized to the foregut within a few hours after an infectious blood meal.  In some fleas, these bacterial aggregates could obstruct blood flow during the fleas next feeding attempt, which correlated with transmission.  Thus, we proposed a unified theory of flea-borne transmission in which both early and later transmission modes occur by regurgitation from fleas in which the foregut is obstructed by masses of Y. pestis at different stages of biofilm maturation. We refined and evaluated new experimental systems to maintain and monitor infection status and transmission efficiency of individual fleas at different times after infection.  The data will be used to estimate values for important parameters such as the probability of flea vectors developing a transmissible infection after feeding on a bacteremic host and the transmission efficiency during a four-week period after infection.  Limited data are available are currently available for these values, which are needed for understanding plague epidemiology.  In collaboration with Dr. Angela Luis at the University of Montana, we have developed mathematical models to better understand conditions that give rise to periodic plague epizootics, and will use our experimentally derived data in these models.  In 2017 we published a summary of many of our experimental protocols for infecting and monitoring fleas on the BEI Resources website (https://www.beiresources.org/Catalog/VectorResources.aspx) as part of their program to provide arthropod vector resources widely available to the research community.We established a collaboration with USGS and USFWS biologists working on a sylvatic plague vaccine for prairie dogs in Montana and South Dakota.  Prairie dog colonies are subject to periodic explosive plague epizootics that can essentially extirpate the colony, which pose a public danger to rural communities and hinder efforts to reintroduce the black-footed ferret, an endangered species.  The conditions that give rise to prairie dog epizootics are enigmatic.  Based on one limited 1940 study, the predominant flea of prairie dogs, O. hirsuta, is a poor vector.  Because of this, alternate transmission routes in addition to the classic flea-borne route have been proposed, none of which add up. We will use our flea infection and transmission monitoring experimental systems to reevaluate the vector competence of prairie dog fleas, which will be collected and provided to us by our USGS and USFWS collaborators.  Similarly, Dr. James Belthoff, Boise State University, is providing P. irritans fleas, which we will also evaluate. This flea is thought to be a poor vector but has controversially been hypothesized to have transmitted Y. pestis from human to human during the European plague epidemics of the Middle Ages.  Reliable vector competence data regarding these fleas will enable more realistic modeling of these epizootiologic/epidemiologic scenarios. In collaboration with the Genomics Unit of the RML Research Technologies Branch, we are examining and characterizing the transcriptomes of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and our biofilm-producing Y. pseudotuberculosis mutant during growth in vitro and during infection of the flea, with the goal of identifying genes and gene regulatory pathways that are important for flea-borne transmission. The in vivo and in vitro transcriptomic comparisons between these three strains are designed to broadly identify candidate components of biofilm regulatory pathways and other genes important for the recent evolutionary adaptation to flea-borne transmission. Significant differences in the expression of orthologous genes in the flea might be indicative of evolutionary changes in gene regulatory pathways.  In a second collaboration with the Genomics Unit, the gene expression response of the flea digestive tract epithelial cells to sterile and infected blood meals was characterized and compared to that of unfed fleas.  Data analysis will disclose the flea digestive system pathways and immune response to oral infection with Y. pestis, about which nothing is known.',\n",
       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause lower respiratory illness (LRI) in otherwise healthy childrenand developing an effective prophylactic vaccine to mitigate RSV disease in infants is a public and globalhealth priority according to the World Health Organization. The overall goal of this project is to develop a safeand efficacious RSV vaccine for immunizing sero-negative 4 months to 2 years old infants, who are beyond thereach of protective RSV maternal antibodies, against RSV hospitalizations and medically attended LRI.Globally, there are 34 million new RSV infections annually with 3.4 million hospitalizations and 66,000 to199,000 deaths. Although most people are infected in the first year of life, recurring RSV infections occurthroughout life. It was estimated that in the US, 2 million children under the age of 5 required care for RSVinfections annually and 78% are over the age of one year. In the US, medical costs for managing RSV diseasein infants were estimated at $1.15 billion annually with additional lost income and caregiver costs estimated at$625 million annually. Vaccinating the birth cohort with a RSV vaccine that has 50% efficacy and protection for12 months was estimated to reduce medical costs by $236 million and income and productivity losses by $134million annually in the US. A live attenuated RSV vaccine mimics natural RSV infection. RSV epidemiology and natural historystudies have demonstrated that natural infection results in lasting protection against severe RSV disease. TheMoore lab recently published on a vaccine candidate that was uniquely engineered to replicate like wild-typevirus in infected cells and yet is less able to spread because of the down-regulation of virulence genes. Theattenuation phenotype is stable because it is conferred by hundreds of mutations in the RSV genome. Theother distinguishing characteristic is a proprietary fusion protein that is enriched for the more immunogenic pre-fusion conformation. The combination of these properties resulted in high levels of attenuation in cotton ratswith almost wtRSV level neutralizing antibodies and complete protection against wtRSV challenge making thisa promising vaccine candidate for clinical development. In Phase 1 the objectives are to generate research stocks of two live attenuated RSV vaccinecandidates called OE4 and DB1Quad and establish a pre-seed process that can be transferred to a cGMPfacility for initiation of vaccine production. In Phase 2, we will evaluate attenuation of OE4 and DB1Quad inhuman airway epithelial cells ex vivo and in cotton rats in vivo and perform studies in cotton rats to verify thatthey do not cause RSV vaccine-enhanced disease. The outcome of these studies will allow Meissa completeIND-enabling pharmacology studies and to prioritize a lead candidate for clinical development.',\n",
       " 'Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are cytoplasmic enveloped RNA viruses of the family Pneumoviridae. Their genomes are single strands of negative-sense RNA of 15.2 kb (RSV) or 13.3 kb (HMPV) that encode 10 mRNAs and 11 unique proteins (RSV) or 8 mRNAs and 9 unique proteins (HMPV). Each virus encodes a nucleoprotein N, phosphoprotein P, matrix protein M, small hydrophobic protein SH, major glycoprotein G, fusion glycoprotein F, polymerase factors M2-1 and M2-2, and the polymerase protein L. In addition, RSV encodes two nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2. Murine pneumonia virus (MPV, previously known as pneumonia virus of mice, PVM) is a close relative of RSV whose natural host is the mouse and which provides a convenient permissive animal model. We presently are developing new attenuated RSV strains as vaccine candidates, but this work is in progress and not ready for presentation. In the present report, we describe a basic research project. We performed (in collaboration with NCATS) a genome-wide high-throughput siRNA screen of more than 20,000 cellular genes to identify cellular proteins involved in RSV infection. Human airway epithelial A549 cells were engineered to express Ds-Red as a viability marker, and were infected with RSV expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker for viral gene expression. Three siRNAs per cellular gene were evaluated individually for reduction in GFP expression as a measure of inhibition of RSV infection. Computer analysis identified and corrected for siRNA off-target effects. The top 155 hits (i.e., the greatest reductions in GFP without excessive loss of viability) were re-evaluated with three additional siRNAs each, and the top 65 hits were identified. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the primary 155 selected candidate genes indicated that integrin signaling was one of the canonical pathways most associated with RSV infection. Among the top 65 genes identified for further analysis, four genes were associated with integrin signaling: actin-related protein 2, ARP2; ADP-ribosylation factor 1, ARF1; integrin alpha-V, ITGAV; and mitogen-activated protein kinase 3, MAPK3.We focused first on actin-related protein 2 (ARP2). ARP2 knockdown by specific siRNA did not reduce RSV entry or gene expression during the first 24 h of infection, but decreased viral gene expression thereafter. This late effect that appeared to be due to inhibition of viral spread to neighboring cells. Consistent with reduced spread, there was a 10-fold reduction in the release of infectious progeny virions in cells in which ARP2 expression was knocked down with specific siRNA. In addition, RSV infection was found to greatly stimulate the formation of filopodia, which are long slender projections from the cell surface. Progeny virus were associated with the filopodia, and contact between these RSV-carrying filopodia and neighboring cells appeared to deliver virus to these neighbors. In addition, RSV infection resulted in increased cell motility in A549 cells, and this motility appeared to be another way in which to deliver progeny RSV to neighboring cells. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of ARP2 expression strongly reduced filopodia formation and motility, indicating a role for ARP2 in both processes. Expression of the RSV F protein alone by a plasmid or heterologous viral vector induced filopodia, indicating a new role for the RSV F protein in RSV infection, specifically in inducing filopodia formation and virus spread. Thus, this study identified roles for ARP2, RSV F protein, and filopodia in RSV production and cell-to-cell spread. In other experiments, we used siRNAs to knock down expression of the other three integrin pathway candidates noted above, namely ARF1, ITGAV, and MAPK3. Knockdown of each of these three proteins reduced the production of progeny RSV, and the effect was increased if ARP2 was simultaneously knocked down. Two of the proteins, namely ARF1 and ITGAV, appeared reduce the efficiency of RSV entry based on siRNA-mediated knock down experiments. Further studies of the underlying mechanism are currently under way. These experiments highlight cellular proteins and cellular pathways that are involved in the various stages of RSV infection and replication.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACTMalaria remains one of the most deadly diseases in the world, killing nearly a million people each year. Malariais hard to control because the immunogenicity of malaria pathogens is very poor, which has made it hard togenerate anti-malaria vaccines. The fast spread of insecticide-resistance in mosquito populations and drug-resistance of Plasmodium parasites further serves to increase the rate of malaria transmission. Therefore,there is critical need for the development of novel approaches for malaria control. Since malaria transmissiondepends on Plasmodium infected mosquitoes, inhibiting parasite infection in mosquitoes represents a noveland practical way to break malaria transmission. At present, most transmission-blocking studies focus onparasite gametocytes in blood with limited success because gametocytes are strongly resistant to drugs.However, very few efforts have been taken to use compounds against mosquito proteins to block malariatransmission. We recently identified the FREP1 gene in wild An. gambiae from malaria endemic areas inKenya through association studies. Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed that the FREP1 proteinmediates the invasion of multiple species of Plasmodium parasites in mosquito midguts through directinteraction with parasites. Based on these findings, we have developed a new high throughput platform toscreen a library of natural fungal extracts targeting FREP1, which enabled our team to identify a bioactivecompound named P-orlandin that significantly inhibits P. falciparum infection in mosquitoes. Based on thesepreliminary studies, we hypothesize that small compounds interfere with malaria-mosquito interaction willinhibit malaria transmission. Since multi-pathways involve Plasmodium invasion in mosquitoes, the overarchinggoal of this application is developing a novel and effective approach for using multiple fungal natural productsto block malaria transmission by targeting multiple mosquito proteins that mediate parasites invasion inmosquitoes. We will use our successful collaborative studies as a springboard for identifying additional targetsthat mediate parasite transmission, as well as small molecules that disrupt the process of malaria transmission.Not only will the compounds we find serve as potential leads for field applications, but they will also serve asessential chemical probes to dissect the molecular biology of the novel pathways we uncover. In this study, wewill identify additional candidate genes through genomic-block assistant-associated studies and verify theirfunctional relationship with P. falciparum infection in mosquitoes. The candidate gene products that promotePlasmodium infection in mosquitoes will be chosen as targets to screen for small molecule compounds thatblock malaria transmission. This work will provide bioactive compounds that are leads for development ofdrugs or spray reagents to block malaria transmission. In addition, this work provides the malaria communitieswith new mechanistic insight into Plasmodium transmission to mosquitoes at a molecular level.',\n",
       " 'Malaria in Malawi has been recalcitrant to the interventions associated with decreased incidence in someneighboring countries. The reasons for the failure of standard prevention and control measures to reduce theburden of malaria in Malawi remain unknown. One possible component is that current interventions aim tocontrol malaria disease but do not adequately target transmission reservoirs to interrupt the spread of infectionin this highly endemic setting. Characterizing transmission from humans to mosquitoes is complex. Identifyingwhich humans harbor gametocytes is insufficient because successful transmission involves multidimensionalrelationships between human and vector behaviors, and complicated human, vector, and parasite biologicalinteractions. Few studies have attempted to fully describe and model the factors that contribute to human tomosquito transmission, yet this information is essential. Our overall goal is to identify the most importantsources of malaria transmission in the human population and to apply this information to optimize the design ofnew strategies to target these reservoirs. We will conduct longitudinal cohort studies including moleculardetection of gametocyte infection, entomological assessments, human behavior characterization andmembrane feeds to: 1) systematically characterize human-to-mosquito transmission patterns to identify theimportant transmission reservoir group(s) for malaria in Malawi, 2) assess the impacts of current interventionson these human reservoirs, and 3) develop analytical models using these data to design and monitor targetedinterventions to efficiently reduce transmission. Our previous work has shown that school-age children havethe highest prevalence of infection and of infections containing gametocytes, and are more available to vectorsdue to relatively infrequent ITN use. We hypothesize that school-age children are the primary reservoirs ofPlasmodium transmission, that current interventions fail to adequately reach this group, and that interventionstargeting this group would considerably reduce the burden of malaria in Malawi. Better understanding ofhuman-to-mosquito transmission dynamics and the transmission reservoirs of Plasmodium in Malawi willimprove the design and evaluation of interventions to target the most important human reservoirs oftransmission and enhance the impact of interventions. The development of evidence-based targetedinterventions will aid Malawi and other high burden settings to tackle the challenge of persistent malaria.',\n",
       " 'A critical component of the electric power system is the underlying network of high voltage transmission lines that connect geographically dispersed generation and load.  The transmission network achieves two important objectives: reducing the cost of energy by providing access to low-cost generation and maintaining reliability by enabling many alternative generation sources and transmission routes to serve load centers.  Although utilities, and more recently regional transmission operators (RTOs), have long engaged in transmission planning, the current context requires planning for larger regions and over longer time horizons.  The uncertainties to which any new transmission lines should be robust to changes in include the types and locations of generation as well as variations in the spatial and temporal distribution of load, both driven by rapid changes in technologies, market factors, and regulations.  The potential sunk cost of transmission lines that do not anticipate future conditions, as well as the expected benefit of properly located transmission additions, can be valued in the millions of dollars.   The transmission planning tools commonly used by utilities and RTOs are well suited for near-term tactical planning when uncertainties are manageable, but are not appropriate to long-term planning when the range of possible future conditions becomes large.  This project develops new methods for transmission planning over several decades and across a wide range of possible futures.Specifically, the research team will develop two alternative algorithms for solving multi-stage stochastic transmission expansion problems: (i) Multi-stage schemes for smoothed nonconvex problems, and (ii) Monte-Carlo and Importance Sampling-based Q-Learning schemes. In the context of both schemes, convergence properties will be analyzed and error bounds will be developed. Furthermore, both sets of schemes will be implemented within a high performance computing environment (such as a network of computing nodes) with an emphasis on asynchronous implementations.  As part of the project, the team will collaborate with the planning group at PJM Interconnection and apply the methods developed to their network, consisting of approximately 16,000 buses.  The application of stochastic analysis will help to identify long-term congestion issues that should be anticipated, and provide an initial list of candidate lines that would be robust to the large set of future scenarios.   More broadly, the development and adoption of these methods will enable planners for regional power systems across the nation to identify crucial additions to the infrastructure that can reduce energy costs, maintain reliability of energy supply, and enable and enhance the ability of new generation technologies to reduce environmental impacts.   The project will also make contributions to education at the graduate and undergraduate levels.   Finally, this project will occur within the Penn State Initiative for Sustainable Electric Power Systems, which organizes workshops and collaborations with the power industry and other academic institutions.',\n",
       " 'The transmission system of the United States, mostly built in the 1960s and 1970s, provides the backbone infrastructure to deliver electricity with great reliability to consumers all over the country. However, the drive towards renewable energy, power electronics, and changes in fuel costs are fundamentally altering the energy landscape. Significant cost and environmental benefits would result from a holistic study of transmission planning at the national scale, based on a high-fidelity modeling of the grid and accurate forecasting models for renewable energy. The goal of this project is to realize a step change in the fidelity, scalability, and performance of transmission planning systems. The research will have scientific as well as broad societal and educational impact. The project will also pioneer methodologies for solving important problems in energy optimization and management, and generate both short-term and long-term technical impacts. Moreover, the research results will be disseminated through education initiatives. Several education plans, including promoting K-12 education and participation of female and underrepresented minority groups in science and engineering, will be undertaken through involvement in various initiatives at the University of Michigan. This research proposes a new generation of transmission planning systems to amplify the benefits of renewable energy, while addressing the challenges created by increasing stochasticity and power electronics. The project relies on high-fidelity models of the grid and novel, hierarchical predictive models for renewable energy and substation loads that capture complex spatio-temporal correlations that are critical in obtaining realistic characterizations of uncertainties. The project brings together four PI and Co-PIs with their expertise in power system optimization, uncertainty quantification, algorithm design, and large-scale distributed computing. It proposes multi-stage stochastic programs over various risk and robustness measures for transmission planning and adopts a prioritization methodology to express planner preferences as the uncertainties are being revealed. It is expected to achieve high computational performance through the use of convex relaxations, large neighborhood search, and parallel implementations of decomposition algorithms. The proposed algorithms will be evaluated on real test cases offered by the largest transmission operator in Europe, ranging from 2,000 to 20,000 buses, as well as synthetic versions from these test cases that are adapted to the realities of the United States.',\n",
       " \"Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at her home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.  The award to Norfolk State University has potential broader impact in a number of areas. The project will focus on constructing a mathematical model to investigate the role of social behavior in the transmission dynamics of HIV epidemics.  The outcomes of this work can inform public health officials when analyzing and determining the impact of social behavior in the transmission of HIV epidemics. This project will also enhance the research experience and training of undergraduate students at Norfolk State University.This project will focus on developing mathematical models, in the form of deterministic systems of nonlinear differential equations, to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the role of risky behavior on the transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS in a population.  Studies have established a strong correlation between risky behavior and the acquisition of HIV infection.  Some of these behaviors are associated with substance abuse. Although it is understood that there are different degrees or stages of substance abuse, the impact of such heterogeneity on the overall disease transmission process has not been rigorously studied.  This project will investigate these dynamics and their role in the transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS in a population.  To achieve this objective, new realistic mathematical models, which incorporate the essential features of HIV disease as well as the dynamics of relevant risky behaviors, will be developed.  These models, which will be rigorously analyzed using techniques from nonlinear dynamical systems, such as asymptotic stability and bifurcation theory, to gain insights into their dynamical features, will be parametrized using available relevant public health and demographic data. Detailed uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, using suitable sampling techniques such as Latin Hypercube Sampling and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients, will be carried out on the parameters of the models to assess the impact of uncertainty in the estimates of the parameter values used in the simulations on the overall simulation results obtained, and determine the most important parameters that drive the disease transmission process.\",\n",
       " 'AbstractNeisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infection is a potential driver of HIV acquisition and transmission. The dynamicstructure of transmission networks governs the spread of infection and can inform public health control efforts.HIV and NG transmission networks may overlap and the overlap can help identify at-risk HIV uninfectedindividuals. The structure of the NG transmission network can be used as a tool for HIV network inference andpotential changes in the network over time. Over the past 75 years, NG infections have become increasinglyresistant to antimicrobial therapy. Cephalosporins in combination with azithromycin are a last line treatmentoption for NG infection and cases of reduced susceptibility to these agents have already been documented.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified drug-resistant NG as one of the topthree urgent infectious threats. Antiretroviral resistant HIV is also an important public health problem that isassociated with poorer treatment outcomes and reduced virologic suppression that could lead to increased riskof transmission. The impact of antibiotic resistant NG on HIV transmission is unknown, however, drug resistantHIV and NG may uniquely impact the transmission networks.This project will support my development as an independent researcher with expertise in molecularepidemiology by providing me with intensive training in scientific areas that are critical for understanding theglobal health threat of HIV and NG, including molecular epidemiology and genetic sequence analysis. Theproposed project will use genetic sequence data from HIV and NG to understand the spread and potentialtransmission dynamics of these infections in Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, California, an important borderregion. The data generated through the proposed work will strengthen local HIV and NG prevention and controlefforts, enhance surveillance data for antibiotic resistant NG, and inform targeted prevention and interventionefforts in this busy border region. Through determination of the structure of HIV and NG transmission networksand an understanding of the factors that drive the transmission of these pathogens, screening, contact tracingand prevention can be appropriately targeted to maximally disrupt HIV and NG transmission networks.This project will build on my background in global health epidemiology and facilitate expertise in HIV and NGmolecular epidemiology and antibiotic resistance. The specific training foci will be: 1) genetic sequenceanalysis of HIV and NG, 2) inference of transmission networks; 3) ethical conduct of prevention, diagnosis andphylogenetic analysis research of HIV and NG; and 4) skills for a successful academic career. I will receive mytraining from experienced mentors with outstanding track records in molecular genetics research. Each mentorhas complementary areas of expertise relevant to my training needs. This proposal builds on previous NIHfunded research and complements current NIH funded projects lead by my mentoring team.',\n",
       " 'Virus circulation among wildlife is a source for disease outbreaks worldwide. The genetic similarity of humans to nonhuman primates (NHPs) provides an opportunity for viruses to decimate both human and animal populations, especially in areas where human-NHP contact has recently increased, as was seen in the most recent Ebola outbreak. Large knowledge gaps persist concerning the dynamics of viral transmission in heterogeneous natural environments. This project will infer and model the transmission routes of adenovirus (AdV), a pathogen common to humans, NHPs, and other sources, in an interconnected biodiversity hotspot in East Africa. There are four main aims for the project: 1) Obtain fine-grained, longitudinal surveillance data on AdV from samples of human, wild non-human primate, domestic animals, flies, water and soil in a natural, heterogeneous environment considered a spillover hotspot, 2) Apply new phylogenetic and bioinformatics tools to next-generation sequencing data for analysis of AdV presence, abundance, and transmission routes within and among these hosts and environs, 3) Identify whether viral transmission is affected more by host proximity or evolutionary relationships, and 4) Develop metapopulation stochastic models to predict how host species composition, diversity, phylogeny, and proximity influence viral transmission routes, with the ultimate aim to explore methods to mitigate disease transmission and benefit human and animal health. This research will not only provide knowledge of virus transmission in a spillover hotspot; in addition, the rigorous protocol itself will be a valuable tool, illustrating how NCBI RefSeq and GenBank data can be used to extend primer sets and reference databases inside state-of-the-art computational tools to viruses. Thus, this project will address some of the grand challenges for infectious disease ecology and evolution, which include the lack of understanding of the contributions of host proximity versus host-relatedness to virus transmission, and the impact of local changes in environmental management on virus transmission. The project builds capacity in Uganda through collaboration with local development organization and data, resources, and knowledge.',\n",
       " 'We initially focused on a PIV3-based vector to express RSV F protein, given the pediatric impact of both viruses. We used an attenuated HPIV3 vaccine candidate called B/HPIV3 that we previously developed. This virus consists of bovine PIV3 in which the F and HN genes have been replaced by those of HPIV3, yielding a chimeric virus that is attenuated in primates due to the bovine backbone, and which bears the neutralization and major protective F and HN antigens of HPIV3. Both the empty B/HPIV3 vector and B/HPIV3 expressing the unmodified RSV F protein were previously shown to be well-tolerated in infants and young children. Therefore, the crucial factor of safety has already been demonstrated for this vector.  A number of strategies were evaluated previously  to optimize the immunogenicity  of the expressed RSV F protein. Evaluation of several different positions for the  RSV F gene in the vector genome identified the second gene position as generally being optimal. Evaluation of several versions of codon-optimization of the RSV F ORF identified the most efficient sequence. The RSV F protein was modified to be identical to an early-passage isolate, which reduced fusion and stabilized the trimer. We also engineered RSV F to be efficiently packaged in the B/HPIV3 vector particle. This was done by replacing the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail (TMCT) of RSV F with those of BPIV3 F. This modification was substantially attenuating but resulted in a large increase in the titers of serum RSV-neutralizing antibodies when assayed in the absence of complement, an assay that detects strongly-neutralizing antibodies. We sought to improve the quality of the RSV F antigen by increasing the stability of the prefusion conformation (the conformation that is the most efficient in inducing neutralizing antibodies)  by structure-based engineering, using mutations that have been reported by colleagues in the NIH Vaccine Research Center and elsewhere. This included the addition of a disulfide bond (called the DS mutation) on its own and in combination with two cavity-filling mutations (called Cav1).  Both the DS and DS-Cav1 forms of RSV F resulted in a large increase in serum RSV-neutralizing antibodies that neutralized efficiently in vitro without added complement. The combination of DS-Cav1 prefusion stabilization, optimized codon-usage, and vector packaging significantly improved vector immunogenicity and protective efficacy against RSV. This provides an improved PIV3-vectored RSV vaccine candidate that will be manufactured into clinical trial maternal for pediatric clinical evaluation. During the present report period, we constructed and evaluated B/HPIV3 constructs expressing additional versions of stabilized prefusion RSV F protein, but these studies are still in progress. We also are constructing and evaluating versions of PIV3 vectors that are less attenuated on their own than B/HPIV3. The use of such a vector would accommodate the added attenuation that results from packaging of the TMCT versions of RSV F. We also used the B/HPIV3 vector to express the RSV attachment glycoprotein (G), which is the second RSV neutralization antigen and a major protective antigen. G contains a conserved fractalkine-like CX3C motif and is expressed as membrane-anchored (mG) and secreted (sG) forms. The CX3C motif and sG are widely  thought to interfere with host immune responses, and it has been suggested that elimination of these features would improve the immunogenicity of an RSV vaccine. We used the rB/HPIV3 vector to express wt RSV G and various modified forms, including  sG, mG, mutants with ablated CX3C motif, and mutants bearing the TMCT of BPIV3 HN to achieve enhanced packaging into vector virions. Using a hamster model, we evaluated the effects of these individual factors on immunogenicity and protective efficacy induced against both the vector and the RSV insert. Furthermore, since PIV3 and RSV have similar tropisms and patterns of replication in vivo, evaluation of the replication of the B/HPIV3 vector provided a means to detect possible changes in the pulmonary immune milieu that might affect RSV/PIV3 replication. In hamsters, all vector constructs replicated to similar titers in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, allowing direct comparison of immune responses. Ablation of sG did not affect the RSV- or PIV3-neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses. Increased packaging did not affect the immunogenicity of RSV G, in contrast to previous findings with RSV F. Mutation of the CX3C motif drastically reduced the G-specific serum NAb response and protection against RSV challenge, indicating the importance of the integrity of the CX3C motif for the immunogenicity of RSV G. In human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures, serum NAbs induced by wt RSV G , but not by wt RSV F, completely blocked RSV infection in the absence of added complement. This activity was reduced if the CX3C motif in the G immunogen was ablated. This suggests that NAbs induced by wt RSV G conferred more complete protection of the epithelium than NAbs induced by wt RSV F. In addition, vector expressing wt G was more protective in hamsters than that expressing wt F against RSV challenge. Increased expression of wt RSV G by codon-optimization increased the immunogenicity and protective efficacy. This study showed that ablation of the CX3C motif in an RSV vaccine, as has been suggested by some, would be ill-advised, and ablation of sG would have no benefit. It suggests that RSV G would be an important component of an RSV vaccine.We also extended the principles described above to HPIV1 vectors. We previously compared HPIV1 vectors that were attenuated by different mutations, and selected a vector containing a 6-nt deletion in the P/C gene (called C-del170), that reduces the ability of HPIV1 to block host interferon and apoptosis responses. We evaluated RSV F protein modified for increased stability in the prefusion conformation by the previously-described DS-Cav1 mutations. RSV F was expressed from the first or second gene position. The TMCT domains were  substituted with those of HPIV1 F, resulting in efficient packaging into the HPIV1 vector virions. In hamsters, the presence of the RSV F gene, and in particular the TMCT versions, was substantially attenuating and thereby resulted in reduced immunogenicity  (due to reduced antigen expression). However, the vector expressing full-length RSV F from the pre-N position was immunogenic for RSV and HPIV1. It conferred complement-independent high-quality RSV-neutralizing antibodies at titers similar to those of wild type RSV and provided protection against RSV challenge. The vectors exhibited stable RSV F expression in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, an attenuated rHPIV1 vector expressing a pre-F-stabilized form of RSV F demonstrated promising immunogenicity and should be further developed as an intranasal bivalent pediatric vaccine.',\n",
       " \"In collaboration with Dr. Fernando Polack (Vanderbilt University) and the Infant Foundation in Buenos Aires, Argentina we recruited a prospective cohort of children aged 0-9 months of age from 5 hospitals in Buenos Aires. The primary clinical outcome is severity of disease (O2 saturation < 93%) and the secondary outcomes are RSV titer and Th2 polarization (blood lymphocytes are isolated and challenged with pro-inflammatory agonists including LPS). From 2003-2006, we recruited approximately 800 children to the study: 400 infected with RSV (240 with severe disease, 160 with mild disease) and 400 controls (uninfected). Our initial genetic analyses have focused on the role of functional SNPs in TLR4 (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile), and NRF2 (-653A/G, -651G/A and -617C/A). These genes have been identified as candidate susceptibility genes for RSV infection in mice, and TLR4 has also been associated with RSV infection in children. In our initial analyses, we found that the -651G/A SNP was only found in severe RSV cases and conferred greater risk of disease relative to the wild type. We also found that children heterozygous for the Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile mutations in TLR4 were at higher risk of severe RSV disease relative to children with wild-type TLR4 genotype. However, when socioeconomic status (SES) was considered, we found children from low SES families and heterozygous for TLR4 Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile mutations had significantly less severe disease compared to wild type (4% severe disease vs 11% severe disease, p<0.05) compared with children from middle/high SES (9% severe disease vs 2% mild disease, p<0.05). These results are consistent with a role for TLR4 in RSV disease severity, but interaction of TLR4 genotype with environment must be considered when evaluating risk of these mutations. We have used human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) to evaluate inter-individual variation in response to RSV, test the role of candidate susceptibility genes, and identify basal gene expression patterns that predict RSV responsivity. Databases on human sequence variation (dbSNP and HapMap) and functional annotation were queried for relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and used to select LCLs with particular genotypes with SNPs of interest. In summary, we found significant inter-individual variation in RSV infectivity across multiple LCLs indicated that genetic background is an important determinant of suscepti bility to infection. Moreover, enhanced (3-5 fold) viral load was found in LCLs with a non-synonymous coding SNP (rs469390) in MX1, which is involved in suppressing viral replication in infected cells. In a case control study of infants with mild or severe RSV disease, a positive association was found between individuals homozygous for the minor allele of rs469390 and development of severe disease. This novel cell model of RSV disease can thus be used translationally to identify functionally relevant candidate susceptibility genes. We also developed a mouse model of RSV disease by infecting 34inbred mouse strains (JAX) with RSV-19 or vehicle control. Significant inter-strain variation in protein, cellular, mucus cell metaplasia (MCM), and RSV-N mRNA expression phenotypes following infection were found among the 34 inbred strains. The most severe RSV disease pathology was found in A/J and Balb/cJ mice, while C3H/HeJ mice were among the most resistant. Collaborating with Dr. Tim Wiltshire (UNC), we then used the SNPster algorithm for haplotype association mapping (HAM) of maximum RSV response phenotypes. Significant associations were found for MCM, RSV-N mRNA, and BAL monocytes, lymphocytes, and PMNs. The most significant association was found on chromosome 1 for BAL monocytes. Within this region are 6 genes that have SNPs that associate with BAL monocytes, including Marco. We identified a non-synonymous coding SNP (rs30741725) that causes a threonine to serine substitution in amino acid 476, and based on predicted protein structure change, this substitution severely affects receptor binding. Further, we also found that relative to Marco+/+ mice, significantly greater histopathological changes and numbers of monocytes and PMNs were found in Marco-/- mice 5 d PI providing additional evidence for a protective role for Marco in RSV disease. Collaborating with Dr. Fernando Polack, each subject from the RSV cohort (described above) was genotyped for a functional loss of function SNP in the MARCO promoter (rs3806496; chrom 2, 119.698574 Mb)and found that it associated with disease severity in RSV-infected infants in two independent populations.  These novel studies support the hypothesis that MARCO is an important determinant of RSV disease severity, and demonstrates the translational value of the model to understand human RSV disease.We then used a combined genetics and genomics approach (genetical genomics) to understand the genetic basis of RSV disease susceptibility. To identify transcripts differentially expressed at baseline that predict response to RSV, baseline lung gene transcript expression for 29 inbred mouse strains (Novartis) was correlated to phenotype data from the RSV strain screen (described above) using linear and random forest regression. These analyses identified a battery of gene transcripts that were differentially expressed at baseline and significantly correlated with RSV disease severity including Ptgs2 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2), Nqo1 (NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1), and IL18bp (interleukin 18 binding protein). To determine whether genotype differences account for differential gene expression we utilized expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis using FastMap. At baseline, there were 125 genes with significant cis-eQTLs, where an association exists between gene expression and genotype at that particular genes locus. Expression of three of these genes significantly correlated with RSV disease phenotypes. Together, these approaches have identified genetic markers of susceptibility to RSV disease to predict severe responders and potentially provide more effective therapeutic targets.Finally, in collaboration with Dr. Michael Resnick's laboratory, we found that RSV induced p53 protein activation, resulting in the expression of several A3 genes in a p53-dependent manner and influencing negatively the virus replication. A SNP in TLR8 regulatory region creates a p53 responsive sequence that renders responsiveness and transcriptional control of this gene by p53. We found that this SNP influences RSV disease severity in infants infected by this virus. As described in the Objectives section of this report, we are currently investigating the immune role that p53 might have during HIV-1 infection. We are also collaborating with Dr. Eric Seaberg at Johns Hopkins University to determine whether functional SNPs in the p53 innate immune axis genes associate with HIV-1 infection and disease progression in individuals from the MACS and WIHS cohorts that have been funded by NIAID for decades. This exciting opportunity will enable us to investigate whether our in vitro findings translate to human populations, and thus is a very strong component to the overall project.\",\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY This revised K23 application is submitted by Lauren Cohee, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease specialistin the Division of Malaria Research at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Dr. Cohee's long-term goalis to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the elimination of malaria by designing andevaluating interventions to decrease P. falciparum transmission. Towards this goal, she proposes a careerdevelopment plan which provides mentored training in mosquito feeding assays, genomics, and microarrayanalysis. Interventions to decrease P. falciparum transmission are critical to achieving the goal of malariaeradication. One promising approach is the development of transmission blocking vaccines. These vaccines aimto induce antibodies that limit parasite development in the mosquito and prevent transmission to the next humanhost. Current vaccine candidate antigens have been identified based on naturally-acquired immune responsesto these antigens resulting in decreased transmission. However, it is not known if either naturally-acquired orvaccine-induced transmission reducing immune responses (TRI) are strain-specific. Strain specificity, meaningfailure of immune responses based on a single strain to provide protection from other strains, has led to limitedefficacy of prior malaria vaccines targeting the asexual disease-causing stage of the parasite. Understanding thestrain-specificity of naturally-acquired and vaccine-induced TRI has significant implications for the potentialsuccess of transmission blocking vaccines as well as studies of the epidemiology of TRI. In the context of alarger study of the dynamics of malaria transmission in Malawi, Dr. Cohee will evaluate the strain-specificity ofnaturally-acquired and vaccine-induced transmission reducing immunity. Specifically, she will use mosquitofeeding assays to measure TRI against multiple parasite strains, including common laboratory strains andMalawian field isolates, using serum from Malawian study participants and monoclonal antibodies totransmission blocking vaccine candidate antigens (Aim 1). She will then identify antibody correlates of theseresponses using a novel diversity-based peptide microarray (Aim 2). The knowledge gained from accomplishingthese aims will 1) inform the rational development of transmission blocking vaccines and 2) identify antibodycorrelates that can be used on a large scale to study the development and epidemiology of TRI to advance ourunderstanding of the dynamics of P. falciparum transmission. Upon completion of this mentored research and training period, Dr. Cohee will be well-positioned to applyfor an R01 to evaluate the development of transmission reducing immunity and determine the dynamics oftransmission reducing immunity in response to malaria control interventions.\",\n",
       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia worldwide, infectingmore than 70% of children in the first year. RSV causes more frequent and severe infections in infantscompared to adults. The development of vaccines has been complicated by the fact that host immuneresponses to RSV play a significant role in disease pathogenesis. A key to RSV pathogenesis may lie indefining the mechanisms associated with a deficient immune response at a time of immunological immaturity.The study of the responses of lung-resident myeloid cells to RSV in human infants has been limited due to thelack of available models. While it is possible to measure cytokines and chemokines present in trachealaspirates in RSV bronchiolitis patients, it is difficult to obtain sufficient numbers of cells to perform mechanisticstudies that might elucidate innate immune pathways that are defective in young children. Therefore, newmodels facilitating control of the timing of infection and cell manipulation are needed to compare the anti-RSVresponses of neonatal and adult myeloid cells. An understanding of these mechanisms can aid in the design ofnew vaccines and therapies.Our long-term research goal is to use a 3D Human Tissue-Engineered Lung Model (3D-HTLM) that exhibits anormal immunological response against infectious agents to elucidate some of the viral and host determinants.The objective of this project is to create a 3D-HTLM that will be used to determine the mechanisms by whichimmunological immaturity leads to greater RSV pathogenesis. An advantage of the lung model is the ability totest the effect of immunological immaturity by comparing the response of young infants and children vs. adultimmune cells to RSV infection. To achieve this goal, the 3D-HTLM will contain the cell types relevant toinfection and an inflammatory response, including vascular endothelium, a respiratory epithelium, supportingstromal cells, and myeloid cells, both resident and inflammatory. The 3D-HTLM includes a 3D scaffold andextracellular matrix materials to allow for the correct cell physiological function and cell-to-cell interactions.We will pursue two specific aims. Aim 1: Determine if the lung microenvironment within the 3D-HTLM instructsthe differentiation of lung resident myeloid cells. Aim 2: Compare the innate immune response of myeloid cellsisolated from neonatal cord blood, young children and adults to RSV infection in the 3D-HTLM.The project will yield new information about the immune response that will provide new targets for preventativeand therapeutic interventions of RSV infection, and the tissue-engineered lung model also may be used fortesting RSV treatment strategies. In addition, expanding our knowledge about how cells interact with eachother and with their environment will vertically advance the field of tissue engineering and the futuredevelopment of an engineered lung for lung transplantation to treat a variety of lung diseases.',\n",
       " 'It is the overarching hypothesis of this project that long-term therapeutic success against humanparainfluenzavirus type 3 (HPIV3) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) will require a combination therapyapproach with a pair of pathogen-directed inhibitors with distinct mechanistic profile. This notion is driven bythe strict safety profile requested by a mostly pediatric patient population and the threat that resistancemutations against individual therapeutics may become fixed rapidly in circulating virus strains. Members of theclosely related paramyxo- and pneumovirus families, HPIV3 and RSV are responsible for the majority ofsevere lower respiratory infection (LRI) and death from viral disease among infants in the United States, andrecognized as a potential threat to the immunocompromised and the elderly. Infection by both pathogensinitiates in the upper respiratory epithelium, followed by gradual progression to the small airways in patientsadvancing to severe disease, opening a window for therapeutic intervention. No vaccine protection or effectivetherapeutic is currently available against either HPIV3 or RSV, and antibody immunoprophylaxis against RSVis restricted to a subset of high-risk patients. This project will address this unmet clinical need by developingapplicable, cost-effective therapeutics targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complexes. Building on an established antiviral program, we have recently identified an efficacious nucleoside analoginhibitor with potent activity against both RSV and HPIV3. Serving as reference, this compound will inform theco-development of allosteric RdRp blockers that are rigorously vetted from early stage development for theirpotential for combination therapy with competitive polymerase inhibitors. In pilot studies, we have engineered arecombinant HPIV3 reporter virus and identified in a high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign using thisstrain two novel, viable HPIV3 polymerase inhibitor scaffolds with sub-micromolar starting potency. AgainstRSV RdRp, we have synthetically redesigned an efficacious allosteric measles virus polymerase blocker andidentified in the resulting pharmacophore-informed library a potent new point-of-entry with anti-RSV RdRpactivity. Recognizing the risk of early stage failure in drug development, we have in parallel identified theprotein-protein interface between the RSV polymerase and encapsidated genome as a promising yetunderexplored druggable site. To further diversify the portfolio also of allosteric anti-RSV candidates, this sitewill be interrogated with an innovative biochemical HTS assay and orthogonal counterscreens (aim 1). Theexisting anti-RSV and anti-HPIV3 leads and newly emerging candidates will be mechanistically characterizedusing next-generation cell based and in vitro polymerase assays, and subjected to resistance profiling singlyand in combination with the reference nucleoside inhibitor (aim 2). Allosteric candidates suitable for RdRp-targeted combination therapy will be synthetically optimized guided by ADME and pharmacokinetic profiles,followed by animal efficacy and toxicity assessment and synergy profiling in cell culture and in vivo (aim 3).',\n",
       " \"A. Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, survives and proliferates in both an arthropod vector and various mammalian hosts. During its transmission/infective cycle, B. burgdorferi encounters environmental challenges specific to those hosts. One challenge comes from reactive oxygen species (ROS) e.g. superoxide radicals (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (OH-) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) e.g. nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen trioxide (N2O3) and peroxynitrite (NO3). There are two stages in the infective cycle when B. burgdorferi is exposed to ROS/RNS. The first is during the initial stages of infection of the mammalian host when cells of the immune system attempt to limit and eliminate B. burgdorferi using several mechanisms including the production of ROS and RNS. Surprisingly, the second ROS/RNS challenge occurs during tick feeding and as the bacteria migrate through the tick salivary glands during transmission.In FY 2018, we determined the roles of osmolarity and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in survival and gene regulation during the infective cycle. B. burgdorferi must adapt to distinctly different environments in its tick vector and various mammalian hosts. Effective colonization (acquisition phase) of a tick requires the bacteria to adapt to tick midgut physiology. Successful transmission (transmission phase) to a mammal requires the bacteria to sense and respond to the midgut environmental cues and up-regulate key virulence factors before transmission to a new host. Our recent data suggests that osmolarity and RNS are such signals. Osmolarity, while constant in the blood, interstitial fluid and tissue of a mammalian host (300 mOsm), osmolarity fluctuates in the midgut of feeding I. scapularis (600-300-600 mOsm). Remarkably, these relatively small changes affect two independent regulatory networks that promote acquisition and long-term survival (Hk1-Rrp1) as well as transmission (Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS) of B. burgdorferi. Most importantly, recent data from our laboratory shows that dicyclic-GMP, produced by Rrp1, stimulates the phosphatase activity of Hk2. We believe this crosstalk is essential for coordinating these two essential regulatory systems. In related studies, we have shown that RNS that are only present in the midgut of feeding ticks, presents a significant challenge to long-term survival of B. burgdorferi. The damage mediated by RNS stimulates the nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER) and mismatch excision repair (MER) systems which ensures maximum growth and long-term survival. Data from Dr. T. Bourrets laboratory at Creighton University suggests that the response to RNS is mediated by DksA and ppGppp (synthesized by RelA). These data suggest that; (1) dicyclic GMP, triggered by osmolarity, might be an important regulatory modulator that coordinates Hk1/Rrp1 and Hk2/Rrp2-dependent regulation, and (2) RNS stimulates DksA-dependent gene regulation that is essential for the long-term survival of B. burgdorferi in ticks (2).B. B. burgdorferi's ability to adapt and survive in very different environments (tick versus mammal) is attributed to its ability to sense changes in temperature, pH, cell density, oxygen, manganese and/or exposure to host factors and alter gene expression accordingly. Previous reports have demonstrated that central to the regulation of these responses are the sigma factors, RpoN and RpoS.  Importantly, RpoN-dependent regulation of RpoS is responsible for the expression of key virulence factors (e.g., OspC, OspA and DbpA) required for infectivity and transmission during the infective cycle. The activities of RpoN are tightly controlled and require ATP-dependent activation. Many of the activators of RpoN-RNA polymerase (RNAP) are response regulators (RR) of two-component regulatory systems and phosphorylation of these RR results in their activation. These RRs are phosphorylated by small molecular weight phosphate donors or, more commonly, by their cognate protein histidine kinase (HK) in response to an environmental signal. The activator of RpoN in B. burgdorferi, Rrp2 encoded by bb0763 (rrp2), is also a RR of a two-component system and rrp2 is in an operon with a gene encoding its cognate protein histidine kinase, Hk2 encoded by bb0764 (hk2).  These regulatory components form the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS signaling cascade that coordinates the expression of virulence factors required for successful transition of B. burgdorferi from its arthropod vector to mammalian hosts. Activation of Rrp2 is essential to initiate this regulatory pathway. The intracellular signal and phosphorylation processes triggering Rrp2 activation are poorly understood. Published reports have suggested that acetyl-phosphate (AcP), a global regulatory molecule in many bacteria, serves as a signal and high energy phosphate donor for Rrp2 activation.In a FY 2018 study led by GRC staff scientist, Dr. D. Dulebohn, we identified an environmental condition that affects gene expression and long-term survival: acid stress (2). Our study identified an acid stress response in B. burgdorferi that activated the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS signal transduction cascade, some BosR-directed oxidative stress response genes, and increased the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in restoring pH homeostasis. An increase in the transcription of these genes was stimulated by membrane-permeable monocarboxylic acids, some of which (acetate and lactate) were identified in the tick midgut following feeding. Moreover, we have now demonstrated that perturbations in pH homeostasis activated the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS/BosR regulatory cascade(s) that was previously attributed to Acetyl-P. We did not identify the intracellular signal that ultimately up-regulates these pathways, however, the effects of the decrease in pHi on the vacuolar ATPase might suggest that ATP or GTP may serve as effective intracellular energy sensors.  While it seemed clear that the acid stress response and pHi effected virulence factor expression in B. burgdorferi in vitro, it seemed unlikely that these parameters affect transmission in vivo. Since the expression of virulence factors, like OspC, are so tightly linked to RpoS, in vitro conditions that trigger Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS and BosR-dependent gene regulation don't necessarily indicate that these conditions are required for, or play a role in, successful transmission. Considering the complexity of the tick midgut, it seems likely that multiple factors are required to maximize and synchronize the expression of virulence factors to the tick feeding cycle to promote successful transmission (4).\",\n",

       " 'Project A:The goal of this study is to better understand how DA receptor subtypes modulate collateral GABA synaptic transmission in the nucleus accimbens (NAc). We use double transgenic mice to express ChR2 in iMSNs or dMSNs and label fluorescently dMSNs. We are thus able to record the collateral GABA transmission between the four combinations of MSN subpopulations. Bath application of the D2-like agonist quinpirole inhibits iMSNdMSN and iMSNiMSN GABA transmission to a similar degree. Interestingly, application of D2-like antagonist sulpiride while washing out quinpirole only partially reverses the inhibition at iMSNdMSN synapses, while it fully reverses the inhibition at iMSNiMSN synapses. Thus, quinpirole inhibition is slightly more potent and more reversible at homotypical synapses from iMSNs to iMSNs. Quinpirole has no effect on dMSNdMSN transmission and only a slight effect at dMSNiMSN transmission, consistent with data from the dorsal striatum (Tecuapetla et al., 2009) that suggests DAs effects on synaptic transmission in the striatum are mainly presynaptic in neurons containing D2Rs. These results suggest D2 receptor activation in the NAc mainly acts presynaptically to depress GABA transmission from iMSNs (a subset of collaterals) and that this presynaptic D2 mediated inhibition of iMSN collaterals is similar regardless of postsynaptic MSN target. We next probed the effects of DA, the endogenous agonist, on synaptic transmission in the NAc in order to better understand how these local collateral synapses might be modulated in vivo where D1 and D2 receptors could be coactivated. To our surprise, we found DA produces a more potent inhibition at these synapses compared to D2-like agonists. High concentration DA inhibits iMSNdMSN transmission almost completely. This inhibition is not blocked by pretreatment with D1-like antagonist and is only partially reduced by D2-like antagonist sulpiride. The partial blockade by D2-like antagonist can be mimicked by the cell-specific genetic deletion of D2Rs from iMSNs, which strongly suggests that only a part of the DA mediated inhibition is carried out by D2Rs and the rest seems insensitive to D1-like or D2-like antagonists. Concentration-response curves of the DA mediated inhibition in both the Adora2a-cre+/- and iMSND2KO mice show that removal of D2Rs produces a rightward shift in the dose-response curve, with an 10 fold change in the IC50 and making DA less potent at inhibiting GABA transmission. These results suggest DA is inhibiting iMSNdMSN transmission through both D2 receptor activation as well as an additional heretofore unknown mechanism. The D2R independent mechanism of the DA inhibition appears to be also mediated by a presynaptic receptor/mechanism as DA has no effect on the amplitude of GABA-A mediated currents produced by uncaging of Rubi-GABA. Further, DA increases the paired-pulse ratio at synapses from iMSND2KO. A long list of pharmacological agents has been used to screen the identity of the D2R-independent modulation of GABA release by DA. These include antagonists for the following receptors: D1-like, alpha-adrenergic, muscarinic, 5HT1b/d, 5HT2a/c, adenosine A1, opioid, GABA-B, and CB1 antagonists. Each had no effect on the DA mediated inhibition in the iMSND2KO mice. Project B: Role for dopamine D2 receptors in the stimulatory and depressive effects of alcoholAlcohol produces both stimulant and sedating effects in humans. Clinical literature suggests that people who experience the stimulant effects of alcohol more intensely are more likely to abuse the substance and develop dependency. In animal studies, stimulant and depressive effects of alcohol can be quantified by locomotive activity. Previous research indicates a role for dopamine receptors in the locomotive effects of alcohol, however, a detailed understanding of the receptor class and localization is unknown. The current study examines the role of specific subpopulations of dopamine D2 receptors in modulating the stimulant and depressant effects of alcohol. Using genetically engineered mice lacking D2 receptors on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum or D2 autoreceptors on midbrain dopamine neurons, we examined dose-dependent alcohol-induced locomotion. Compared with littermate controls, MSN D2 knockout mice show a significantly increased locomotor response to alcohol, while the mice lacking D2 autoreceptors are more sensitive to the depressive effects of alcohol. To assess differences in alcohol-induced sedation in each of the mouse lines, we performed the Loss of Righting Reflex (LORR). LORR data show that MSN D2 knockout mice are more resilient to the sedative effects of alcohol, with only 50% of mice losing the righting reflex. Meanwhile, D2 autoreceptor knockout mice lose and regained the righting reflex after a high dose of alcohol similar to control mice. To further explore the rewarding and reinforcing aspects of alcohol in these transgenic mice, we examined intake parameters. MSN D2 knockout mice showed ahigher preference for alcohol than controls in a two-bottle choice test and increased seeking in a self-administration paradigm. MSN D2 knockout mice show resilience to quinine adulteration of alcohol compared to controls. These results suggest that MSN striatal dopamine D2 receptors may be playing an important role in modulating the behavioral responses to alcohol. This may provide an explanation for the variation in individuals responses to the stimulant effects of alcohol and the resulting susceptibility to abuse and dependence.Project C: Lack of LRRK2, a Parkinsons disease-related protein, promotes compulsive-like and high alcohol intake in mice. High alcohol drinking and consumption despite aversive consequences is a characteristic of alcohol use disorders. The progression from controlled alcohol use to more compulsive drinking is influenced by many factors, such as psychological, environmental and genetic factors. In order to elucidate the genetic components implicated in the development of the compulsive alcohol consumption, we evaluated changes in the whole striatal transcriptome using a murine model of chronic and free choice alcohol intake. In this model, 60 outbred mice had access to alcohol in a three-bottle choice way during four stages: Acquisition (10 weeks), Withdraw (2 weeks), Re-exposure (2 weeks) and Adulteration (2 weeks, access to alcohol solutions adulterated with bitter tasting quinine).  After treatment, animals were classified according to their individual alcohol intake as  Light drinkers  (preference for water throughout the experiment),  Heavy drinkers  (preference for alcohol, but significantly intake reduction after the alcohol taste-adulteration) and  Inflexible drinkers  (preference for alcohol even after the taste-adulteration). In the transcriptome analysis, we found that the expression of Lrrk2 gene was increased exclusively in those mice that were Inflexible drinkers. The Lrrk2  gene produces an AKAP protein which regulates the PKA availability in medium spiny neurons and it is responsible for controlling several neuronal functions. Further validations using the full knockout mice for the Lrrk2 gene (Lrrk2-KO) showed that those animals have an enhanced alcohol preference and consumption when compared with the wild types. Also, Lrrk2-KO mice achieved a higher breakpoint in a progressive ratio schedule, indicating an increased motivation to both alcohol seeking and taking. Compulsive-like behavior were accessed by measuring preference for 3 weeks and by alcohol adulteration test. Once again, Lrrk2-KO mice showed high alcohol intake despite the taste-adulteration, suggesting enhanced compulsive-like alcohol consumption in mice lacking the Lrrk2 gene. Furthermore, the Lrrk2-KO mice showed an increased basal anxiety-like behavior, spending a shorter time on the cen',\n",
       " 'Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading infectious disease killer globally and is largely driven by transmission inhigh incidence settings. Studies to date, however, have not been able to identify where the majority oftransmission is occurring. TB transmission has traditionally been attributed to prolonged, close contact, butnumerous studies have shown that only 9–30% of genotypically linked cases can be attributed to closecontact. A compelling alternative hypothesis is that the remaining 70% of transmission occurs due to casualcontact in the community, but this has never been verified. A better understanding of where transmissionoccurs will enable the design of more effective interventions to curb TB incidence. In the Transmission of HIV-Associated XDR TB (TRAX) study in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, wedemonstrated that extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB is primarily driven by transmission, rather than acquiredresistance, overturning the prevailing belief. However, similar to drug-susceptible TB, less than one-third ofdrug-resistant TB cases could be linked through close contact. Drug-resistant TB provides a unique opportunityto study transmission due to casual contact, as the limited caseload allows for comprehensive genotyping toidentify transmission links between individuals who may name each other in a contact investigation. In the proposed study, we will test a novel hypothesis that casual contact and migration are fueling TBtransmission in high incidence settings. Rising rates of urbanization and migration throughout Asia and Africahave created favorable conditions for TB transmission. Yet, to date, no studies have comprehensively studiedhow migration may facilitate the spread of TB from urban to rural settings. In Aim 1, we will determine theproportion of XDR TB that develops through casual contact and identify locations where transmission occursusing genomic, social network, and geospatial analyses. In Aim 2, we will characterize migration patternsamong persons diagnosed with XDR TB in Durban to determine how migration creates opportunities for XDRTB dissemination. In Aim 3, we will quantify the proportion of XDR TB cases from throughout KwaZulu-Natalprovince that are genomically linked to cases in Durban using whole genome sequencing. The aims proposed in the CONTEXT (Casual Contact and Migration in the Transmission of XDR TB)study build upon our established research infrastructure and successful track record of combining state-of-the-art methodologies to gain insight into TB transmission. New knowledge from this study will be essential forinforming evidence-based interventions to halt TB transmission and reduce drug-susceptible and drug-resistantTB incidence. This will include near real-time data on genomically linked TB cases, as well as the identificationof locations that will be highest yield for targeting interventions to decrease airborne transmission. Together,the knowledge and integrated methodology created from this study will catalyze the significant declines inglobal TB incidence needed to achieve the global EndTB 2035 goals.',\n",
       " 'Lung disease caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection is a significant burden on global humanhealth. Very young children and bone marrow transplant recipients are particularly vulnerable to developingsevere lung disease. Current treatments are limited and costly. There are no licensed anti-virals or vaccinesspecific for RSV currently available to alleviate lung disease caused by RSV infection. The preclinical development of therapeutics to treat RSV infections has been hampered by the lack of easilyaccessible small animal in vivo models that recapitulate the nature and magnitude of RSV infection and airwaypathology of RSV infection of humans. This proposal explores genetically engineered hamsters as new modelsof RSV infection and disease for pre-clinical testing of RSV therapeutics. Preliminary studies suggest these newhamster models recapitulate the kinetics and airway pathology of RSV infection of human airways. We have taken a rational approach in designing our hamster models. As RSV infection degrades STAT2 toenhance virus replication in human cells, but not rodent cells, we reasoned hamsters, normally only semi-permissive for RSV infection, may become more permissive to infection if deleted of STAT2. Our preliminarystudies comparing RSV infection in wild-type versus hamsters deleted of STAT2 (STAT2-/-) confirmed this notionwith more robust infection in the upper and lower airways of STAT 2-/- hamsters. These studies also revealed amore significant airway pathology in STAT2-/- hamsters infected by RSV, likely related to the increased infectionand replication rates, and with striking similarities to the airway pathology seen in RSV-infected humans. Wepropose STAT2-/- hamsters provide an authentic small animal model for testing RSV therapeutics. Aim 1 focuseson quantitative assessment of RSV infection and subsequent airway pathology in STAT2-/- hamsters to providea framework of outcome measures for future testing of new therapeutic approaches. Bone marrow transplant recipients represent the other vulnerable patient population suffering prolonged andmore severe RSV infections. The development of potent anti-virals and other approaches to alleviate airwaydisease are required as this population will likely benefit less from RSV vaccine approaches. By crossing STAT2-/- hamsters with hamsters deleted of RAG2 (RAG2-/-), an important modulator of lymphocyte differentiation, wenext generate a hamster model deleted of STAT2 which is also deficient in T and B lymphocytes. Aim 2 focuseson testing whether STAT2 and RAG2 double knockout hamsters develop robust and prolonged RSV infectionsand more severe airway pathology, thus providing a model of RSV infection in bone marrow transplant recipients. These studies aim to provide the RSV community with more authentic and easily accessible small animalmodels for pre-clinical testing of RSV therapeutics in two of the most vulnerable patient populations to RSVinfection; otherwise healthy children and bone marrow transplant recipients.',\n",
       " 'According to the World Health Organization, the global burden of tuberculosis peaked in 2000 and has sincedeclined by 1.5% per year. This modest progress falls short of the Millennial Development Goals fortuberculosis elimination. Moreover, this average decline hides important variation in the incidence andprevalence of tuberculosis around the world today. This variation highlights that determinants of diseaseincidence may differ across regions, so interventions must be tailored to local the epidemiology of disease. Thestandard approach to tuberculosis control today relies on detection and treatment of prevalent tuberculosiscases. This approach may have limited effectiveness in areas of high tuberculosis burden where M.tuberculosis transmission is correspondingly high. Indeed, by the time a case is diagnosed and treated, thenext generation of cases has already been newly infected. To make progress in curbing the epidemic oftuberculosis, new cases must be prevented, either by reducing transmission or by preventing disease.Household contact investigation has been a mainstay of active case finding of tuberculosis for decades.Although the household is a setting of intense transmission of tuberculosis, household transmission accountsfor less than 25% of tuberculosis that occurs in a given community. While the household is a convenient,localized social network for transmission that is easily identified and evaluated, we must better understand thecomplex community networks that support M. tuberculosis transmission and lead to disease ‘hotspots’.The goal of this proposal is to develop methods for measuring community networks that support tuberculosistransmission. In this proposal, we plan to reconstruct the social and mobility networks of infectious tuberculosiscases before diagnosis by using cellular telephone metadata and integrate this information with whole genomesequences of the M. tuberculosis strains from index cases to infer transmission networks. The Specific Aimsare: 1) To assess the movement of pulmonary tuberculosis cases before diagnosis as an indicator of M.tuberculosis transmission in an urban African community; 2) To infer transmission trees of M. tuberculosis in anurban African community using whole genome sequencing of isolates from tuberculosis index cases and relatetransmission inferences to social networks and mobility patterns.To address these aims, we will expand the design of our current project by collecting archived cellulartelephone metadata from index cases for one year prior to the diagnosis of tuberculosis. We will then constructsocio-mobility networks that map movement within the community prior to diagnosis of tuberculosis. We willuse whole genome sequencing of isolates collected from case networks to reconstruct transmission treesusing a Bayesian framework which combines social and mobility networks with phylogenetic information. Thisnovel approach to mapping transmission may give tuberculosis control programs a useful way to tailor publichealth interventions that are responsive to the local epidemiology of tuberculosis.',\n",
       " 'Studies on asexual stage immunity to P. falciparum 1.) Evaluate the merozoite antigen PfRH5 as a vaccine candidate. Our collaborators at Oxford University (Dr. Simon Draper et al.) are pursuing this protein as a vaccine candidate and we have contributed to various pre-clinical studies using our standardized growth-inhibition assay (GIA). One clinical trial using immunization with recombinant viruses has already been completed but the immunogenicity was not sufficient to justify a parasite challenge. However, a second clinical trial using recombinant protein has been conducted and showed about 20% reduction in parasite growth. This is the first time that positive results have been seen with a blood stage vaccine and we are completing GIA studies from this trial. 2.) In addition, we have initiated a detailed study of immune responses in field sites to PfRH5 as well as other associated molecules which are part of an invasion complex with this molecule - PfCyRPA, PfRipr, etc. Antibody titers in Malians to these proteins are very low but we are isolating their specific antibodies and will study their functionality.3.) Other targets of merozoite immunity - AMA1. We have collaborated with Dr. Lou Miller to show that using AMA1 in conjunction with its partner protein RON2 produces antibodies with greater activity in the GIA assay. 4.) Studies of immunity to malaria in Kenieroba, Mali. Our 4-year investigation of the acquisition of immunity to malaria in Malian children represents perhaps the most detailed longitudinal study of malaria in African children that has been conducted. Antisera collected in this 4-year study continue to be used to evaluate other blood-stage vaccine candidates. 5.) We continue to work with Drs. Amy Bei and Dyann Wirth (Harvard University), who are studying changes in frequency of different P.falciparum clones over time in Senegal. We have collaborated in examining the influence of human immune responses on the changes in clonal parasite patterns, particularly related to the observation of parasites with common genetic signatures (CGS). 6.) We are also collaborating with Oxford University on a major EU-funded project to develop a 3-stage multi-component vaccine for P. falciparum.7.) We are starting a collaboration with Drs. Peter Crompton/Joshua Tan, and Robert Seder to do high throughput identification of human monoclonal antibodies to whole parasites and recombinant proteins of malaria.8) We have collaborated with Oxford investigators on passive transfer of monoclonal antibodies into Aotus monkeys then challenged with malaria parasites. 9.) We have made significant headway on identification of a DNA aptamer which can specifically identify piperaquine, one of the partner drugs for artemisinin that is used for treatment of malaria around the world. This sensor now provides a platform for the development of a kit to detect this drug in human blood.10) We have initiated studies of Plasmodium vivax to identify a biomarker of infection to improve detection kits.Studies on parasite sexual stages and transmission blocking vaccine candidates:1.) Develop quantitative methodology for analysis of the standard mosquito membrane feeding assay (SMFA) to evaluate transmission blocking activity. The gold standard assay to evaluate the ability of antibodies to block transmission to mosquitoes is the SMFA, and we have performed an in depth study of this assay in order to have confidence in assessing potential transmission blocking vaccine (TBV) candidates. We have previously shown that the SMFA is quite reproducible at high concentrations of antibody but highly variable at low concentrations, and we have worked with the Biostatistics group at NIAID to develop a model of the assay. Recently we have tested a modified model of the assay to show for the first time that we can predict the impact of a specific antibody on the reduction of P. falciparum parasite prevalence in mosquitoes based on the reduction in oocysts in an SMFA and the number of oocysts in control mosquitoes. Reduction in malaria prevalence in mosquitoes by an antibody is key to reducing transmission in the field. 2.) Search for and evaluate new possible transmission blocking vaccine candidates. Using SMFA we have evaluated a number of potential transmission blocking vaccine candidates. We have tested antibodies to significant numbers of sexual stage and mosquito vaccine candidates to compare their activity.3.) Construction and evaluation of human/humanized monoclonal antibodies (mabs) to several sexual stage parasite proteins. We are currently comparing several mabs to Pfs25 and other candidates as a foundation for human clinical trials. Passive administration of these antibodies will allow evaluation of transmission blocking in vivo and might eventually be used in elimination campaigns. We are comparing them in SMFA, mapping their epitopes, and determining their binding properties.4.) We are continuing studies to examine the differentiation pattern of P. falciparum gametocytes in culture using RNASeq. We have obtained data on RNA transcription during 2- weeks of differentiation and we are analyzing the data to identify better markers of early and late stage gametocyte development. 5.) We are continuing a series of experiments to determine what serum-derived factors are necessary for successful differentiation of gametocytes so that robust numbers of oocysts can be obtained after mosquito infection. Mass spectrometry of  good  and  bad  sera have shown consistent differences between them (M Llinas collaboration).6.) We have initiated studies on PfHAP2 as a novel transmission blocking vaccine candidate and we are starting new studies to identify other transmission blocking vaccine candidates with the group at Ehime University in Japan (T. Tsuboi).7.) We are part of a consortium of investigators led by Oxford University (S. Biswas) and funded by the EU to develop a transmission blocking vaccine.Field studies of malaria transmission in Mali1.) We have assessed the presence of asexual and sexual stage parasites in residents of Kenieroba, Mali throughout the year. In the spring of 2013 we initiated a new study (NIH 13-I-N107) to address the limited information on transmission in malaria endemic areas, and in 2014 we completed the field aspect of this study. Volunteers representing all age groups were finger pricked twice per month for 1 year to collect DNA and RNA. We previously completed analysis of over 10,000 samples of parasite DNA on filter paper. In November, 2013 (wet season), P. falciparum prevalence in the cohort was 37.0%, and in May of 2014 (dry season), the prevalence dropped to 10.0%. We also analyzed the longitudinal prevalence of the cohort; we observed that the 9-16 years old age group had the highest median longitudinal prevalence compared to the other age groups, and males had a higher median than females (22.0%). 2.)We showed for the first time that increasing P.falciparum longitudinal prevalence throughout the year was associated with decreasing risk of clinical malaria. This suggests that those with persistent parasite carriage acquire stronger protective immunity. 3.) We added a new barcoding procedure based on a methodology developed at Harvard University to determine how many different clones of parasites an individual was carrying. This allowed us to show that at least 70% of infections were polygenomic, so that most people in the population are carrying more than one parasite clone at any given time. Moreover, this distribution held during both the wet and dry seasons of the year.4.) Using RNA collections from the same study, we used a qRT-PCR procedure to identify Pfs25 mRNA specific for gametocytes. More than 80% of people with parasites also have detectable gametocytes so that no one group can be uniquely targeted',\n",
       " 'Project AbstractHAND HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) including asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment(ANI), mild neurocognitive disorders (MND) and HIV-associated dementia (HAD) persist despite effectiveantiretroviral therapy (ART). HAD is markedly decreased but ANI and MND persist and affecting 25-50% ofART-treated individuals. With durable ART, there is emergent evidence of chronic immune system activationthat contributes to AIDS-related co-morbidities including HAND and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Chronicimmune activation that includes activated monocyte/macrophages and markers on these cells are consistentlyassociated with these comorbidities. While the mechanisms for chronic immune activation with HIV and ARTaren’t well understood, microbial translocation, secondary infections and residual viral replication in cell andtissue reservoirs likely play a role. Central to all these mechanisms is activated monocyte/macrophages. Inaddition to memory CD4+ T cells, macrophages are cellular reservoirs for latent HIV, and the central nervoussystem (CNS) is a tissue reservoir for HIV- DNA.

       " \"AbstractRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and youngchildren, however no vaccine is currently available. The overall objective of this grant is to develop optimal liveattenuated RSV vaccine candidate(s). The significance of this P01 is that it brings together a multidisciplinarygroup of investigators to leverage a novel observation that infants with severe RSV disease display a pattern ofinadequate (or suppressed) immune responses. The grant will simultaneously attack this problem on multiplefronts by developing a vaccine with increased immunogenicity, attenuating the virus in a novel, `tunable' way,improving its yield in cell culture to improve vaccine production, and using gene expression and new antibodydetection tools for analysis of the immune response in order to predict vaccine effectiveness and safety. Thesecandidates will be tested first in vitro in primary well differentiated human airway epithelial cultures. Vaccinecandidates with the desired characteristics will be selected for testing in vivo in cotton rats for their attenuationand their ability to induce a `safe' host response (similar to natural mild RSV disease in infants), and potentneutralizing antibodies to RSV. Combination mutants will be recycled through this system, resulting in theselection of one optimal vaccine candidate and rank order of excellent backups. By integrating the hostresponse to RSV infection with modifications of the virus that improve these responses, the four projects of thisP01 will synergize to develop an optimized live attenuated RSV vaccine candidate ready for testing in humanprimates and possibly clinical trials.\",\n",
       " 'This project conducts clinical trials of live intranasal pediatric vaccine candidates that we have made for human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 (HPIV1, 2, and 3), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). We presently are focusing on RSV. We are conducting Phase 1 pediatric clinical trials of multiple live-attenuated RSV strains of our design. The goal is to identify one or two lead candidates suitable for further development as an intranasal pediatric RSV vaccine. This is being done under a Cooperative Research and Development Award (CRADA) with Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. One lineage of live-attenuated RSV vaccine candidates that has been under development involves attenuation mainly by point mutations, and is exemplified by the virus rA2cp248/404/1030delSH. Previously, this virus appeared to be appropriately attenuated and moderately immunogenic in 6-24 month old seronegative children and 1-2 month old RSV-naive young infants, and was our previous lead candidate. However, this virus exhibited genetic instability that primarily involved two major attenuating temperature-sensitivity (ts) missense mutations in the L protein called 248 and 1030 (which involve L codons 831 and 1321, respectively). We previously developed new versions of these two mutations that were modified for increased genetic stability (called 248s and 1030s). We then incorporated these two stabilized mutations together with the other mutations of rA2cp248/404/1030delSH into a new virus called RSV cps2. This virus has now been evaluated in a Phase 1 pediatric clinical trial in seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT01852266 and NCT01968083). This virus was highly attenuated. Sequence analysis of shed vaccine virus from vaccinees did not detect any de-attenuation at the stabilized attenuating mutations 248s or 1030s, confirming that substantial stabilization of these mutations indeed had been achieved. Unfortunately, the cps2 virus proved to be somewhat more attenuated than the previously-evaluated rA2cp248/404/1030delSH virus. We believe the greater attenuation of cps2 is because this virus was constructed using a backbone that had a number of other point mutations compared to rA2cp248/404/1030delSH. At the time cps2 was made, these additional mutations were thought to be incidental, but more recently we have been finding that seemingly-incidental differences in ostensibly-wild-type backbones can be associated with increased attenuation, and this likely is the case with cps2. Therefore, we believe that the incorporation of the 248s and 1030s mutations into the exact rA2cp248/404/1030delSH backbone would create a more stable version that retains the desirable attenuation phenotype of rA2cp248/404/1030delSH. This virus will be made, but with regard to clinical trials we will focus on other vaccine virus lineages (see below) that may have more advantageous properties. The stabilized 248 and 1030 mutations, as well as a stabilized codon-deletion mutation (del1313/I1314L) that we also developed, also are available for use in other backbones; for example, the 1030s and del1313/I1314L mutations have been combined with the NS2 and M2-2 gene-deletions in other vaccine candidates (see below, and results not shown).  A second lineage of RSV vaccine candidates involves deletion of the ORF encoding the small (90 amino acids) viral M2-2 protein (delM2-2 lineage). The M2-2 protein plays a role in regulating RSV RNA synthesis, and its deletion results in  down-regulated viral RNA replication (causing viral attenuation) and up-regulated viral gene transcription and antigen synthesis. Increased antigen expression per genome raises the possibility of increased immunogenicity per infectious particle. We have been evaluating several versions of delM2-2 viruses in Phase 1 clinical trials in RSV-seronegative children 6-24 months of age. A prototype virus called RSV MEDI/delM2-2 was evaluated in seronegative infants 6-24 months of age (NCT01459198). This virus was very highly attenuated for replication, and possibly was more attenuated than necessary. Nonetheless, compared to the rA2cp248/404/1030delSH virus described above, the MEDI/delM2-2 virus induced significantly higher titers of serum RSV-neutralizing antibodies. Thus, it indeed appeared to have increased immunogenicity per infectious particle. Surveillance during the subsequent RSV season provided presumptive evidence of protection against wild-type RSV infection, as well as strong anamnestic RSV-specific antibody responses.A second delM2-2-based candidate, called RSV LID/delM2-2, was evaluated in similar Phase 1 studies (NCT02040831 and NCT02237209). Unexpectedly, the LID/delM2-2 virus was substantially less restricted than MEDI/delM2-2, and may be insufficiently attenuated. The difference in attenuation between these two viruses appears to involve a number of sequence differences in the two viral backbones. The LID/delM2-2 virus was more immunogenic than MEDI/delM2-2, presumably due to its increased replication.Because MEDI/delM2-2 may be more attenuated than needed, while LID/delM2-2 may be under-attenuated, we sought to identify a delM2-2 virus that was intermediate between the two. Thus, several other delM2-2 viruses presently are under evaluation in small Phase 1 trials, namely RSV D46/cp/delM2-2 (NCT02601612), RSV LID/delM2-2/1030s (NCT02794870 and NCT0252339), RSV LID/cp/delM2-2 (NCT02890381 and NCT02948127), RSV D46/NS2/N/delM2-2 (NCT03099291 and NCT03102034), and RSV 276 (NCT03227029 and NCT03422237). These studies are in progress. A third lineage of RSV vaccine candidates contains deletion of the NS2 gene (delNS2 lineage), whose encoded protein antagonizes host responses to viral infection, notably the type I interferon (IFN) and apoptosis responses.  In one candidate, the delNS2 mutation was combined with the del1313/I1314L mutation, creating the virus RSV delNS2/del1313/I1314L. This virus is being evaluated in Phase 1 pediatric clinical trials, in one case on its own (NCT01893554), and in a second case in a head-to-head comparison with the delM2-2 virus called RSV 276 noted above (NCT03227029 and NCT03422237). In a second candidate, the delNS2 mutation was combined with the stabilized 1030s mutation noted above (which consists of Y1321K and S1313(TCA) in the L ORF). This created the virus RSV delNS2/1030s. This virus also is being evaluated in a Phase 1 pediatric clinical study (NCT03387137). The 1030s mutation is somewhat less attenuating than the del1313/I1314L mutation, and thus these two viruses should exhibit a range of attenuation phenotypes. A fourth lineage of RSV vaccine candidates contains deletion of the NS1 gene (delNS1 lineage) that, like NS2, encodes a protein that antagonizes host interferon and apoptosis responses, but does so more efficiently than NS2 and thus might confer a phenotype that is more attenuated and immunogenic. Two viruses were made that each contain the delNS1 deletion as the sole attenuating element, but in one virus the F and G genes have been moved to the first and second genome positions in order to increase their expression (RSV 6120/delNS1 and 6120/F1G2/delNS1, respectively). These viruses presently are being compared head-to-head in a Phase 1 pediatric clinical trial (NCT03596801).In collaboration with the Medical Virology Section, cDNA-derived RSV strain A2 presently is being evaluated in an in-patient setting for infectivity, replication, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity in healthy adult volunteers in a dose-escalation study (NCT02484417). This will provide an infection model that can be used to evaluate anti-RSV drug candidates and adult RSV vaccine candidates, and to study viral pathogenesis and the host response.',\n",
       " 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and small children. RSV infection in mice is characterized by significant immunopathology which is mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Past studies have suggested that CD8+ T cells with different functional properties and characteristics can be elicited following infection or immunization, and may have differential effects on viral clearance and RSV-associated illness. These differences in clonotype, functional avidity, and other intrinsic parameters of the CD8+ T cell response may dictate the epitope hierarchy established following infection. In dissecting the CD8+ T cell responses in mice, we have discovered differences between neonatal and adult CD8+ T cell responses elicited during RSV infection and have now defined the dynamics of lung-migratory dendritic cell populations in the lung and lung-draining lymph nodes of RSV-infected mice during early life as compared to adulthood. These dendritic cells were found to induce T cell responses in an age-dependent manner, and we have implicated lower costimulatory molecule expression by neonatal dendritic cells as one mechanism for this difference. We have recently developed a murine adult bone-marrow and fetal liver dendritic cell culture model to further characterize the phenotype and function of important dendritic cell subset.  We continue to collaborate with a group at Leiden Institute of Chemistry to investigate mechanisms of controlling CD8+ T cell recognition using chemical methods.  Additionally, we have examined the contribution of CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells to immunopathology and viral clearance. CD4 T cells can influence and regulate the function of other immune effectors including CD8 T cells. In addition to the potential role of Th2 CD4 T cells in RSV pathogenesis as mentioned above, T regulatory cells have properties that suggest they may be important in RSV immunity and pathogenesis. We are currently evaluating the recruitment of regulatory T cells during primary and secondary infections.  Finally, we have demonstrated that intranasal vaccination with murine cytomegalovirus vectors that persistently expressing RSV antigens promotes tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells which protect against RSV challenge.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARYRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of infant hospitalizations in the U.S., and the diseaseburden among the elderly is similar to non-pandemic influenza A. Traditional strategies have failed to generatean effective RSV vaccine, and in some instances vaccination resulted in enhanced disease, underscoring thecomplexity of the human immune response to RSV. Although a prophylactic antibody is available (palivizumab,a humanized mouse mAb marketed by MedImmune as Synagis™), its high cost and modest efficacy haverestricted its use to high-risk infants. Moreover, due to this high cost, palivizumab is inaccessible to children indeveloping nations and is unavailable in 4 of the 5 most populous countries – more than half the world'spopulation does not have access to this type of treatment.The public health benefit and the worldwide accessibility would undoubtedly be improved by lowering the costof RSV immunoprophylaxis. In this Phase 1 proposal, Dartmouth College (Hanover, NH), Adimab (Lebanon,NH), and Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc. (San Diego, CA), are teaming to develop a fully human mAb with thefollowing properties: 1) > 50-fold neutralization potency versus palivizumab and at least 2-fold more potent invitro and in vivo than Medimmune and Regeneron's current clinical candidates (MEDI8897/REGN2222); 2)binds a different epitope than palivizumab and neutralizes palivizumab-resistant strains; and 3) Increasedserum half-life so injections can be administered once per RSV season rather than monthly as required forpalivizumab. With a more potent mAb (i.e. lower dose) that can be dosed less frequently, the team's objectiveis to dramatically lower the price for RSV immunoprophylaxis. In addition, competition in the marketplacewould also help to reduce costs since palivizumab currently has a monopoly on the RSV market.We propose the following Specific Aims to accomplish our objective: 1) Engineer and produce the best in vitroneutralizing mAbs with and without fucosylation of N-glycans; 2) Select lead candidates for advancement to invivo testing using neutralization potency and manufacturability criteria; 3) Determine the in vivo potency of theneutralizing mAbs produced with or without fucosylation.\",\n",
       " 'Project SummaryIn this project, the Jardetzky and Crowe laboratories will collaborate to investigate the neutralizing antibodyresponse to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV), using complementarystructural, biochemical and immunological approaches. RSV and HMPV are respiratory viruses that causewidespread morbidity within the human population second only to influenza virus. RSV is the most commoncause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants worldwide. The virus also impacts the elderly and others withweakened immune systems. HMPV was identified in 2001 and has been causing respiratory illnesses in thehuman population for over 50 years. Similar to RSV, HMPV infections are associated with a significant burdenof hospitalizations and clinic visits in young children and in the elderly. Despite limited antigenic variation, RSVand HMPV cause repeated infections throughout life and are associated with a lack of induction of durableimmunity. A clear explanation for this ability of the viruses to reinfect previously exposed individuals is stilllacking, although multiple hypotheses have been developed. The RSV and HMPV fusion (F) proteins are themajor targets of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), and nAbs targeting the prefusion conformation of the RSV Fprotein have been shown to be the most potent inhibitors of viral entry. However, our understanding of theantibody response to HMPV is much more limited. In this proposal, the Jardetzky and Crowe laboratories willaddress outstanding issues in RSV and HMPV antibody immunity by studying monoclonal and repertoire-based B cell responses to both viruses, conducting functional and structural mapping of antibody epitopes andstudying the sequence determinants of HMPV F conformational stabilization.!',\n",
       " 'Academic Research Enhancement Award (R15) Action Mechanisms of Resveratrol in Somatic Longevity and Reproductive System PROJECT SUMMARY Resveratrol (RSV) has emerged as a highly effective, longevity-promoting small molecule. Althoughseveral studies have shown that RSV extends lifespan through Sirtuin (a family of NAD+-dependentdeacetylases)-dependent pathways, there is still much controversy surrounding the underlying mechanismsof this lifespan extension effect. Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), we found that RSV-mediated longevity largelydepends on both SIR-2.1 (a Sirtuin/SIRT1 homolog) and MPK-1 (an ERK/MAPK homolog). Specifically, RSVpartially extended lifespan in single mutant worms lacking either SIR-2.1(SIRT1) or MPK-1(ERK), comparedto that of wild-type worms. However, RSV-mediated longevity was completely abolished in double mutantworms lacking both SIR-2.1(SIRT1) and MPK-1(ERK). In addition to somatic longevity, we found that RSVhas both positive and negative effects on the reproductive system depending on the genetic context – RSVpromotes both reproductive longevity via SIR-2.1(SIRT1) and the formation of MPK-1(ERK)-associatedgermline tumors in a specific genetic mutant. In this proposal, we aim to investigate the molecular mechanism of how RSV cooperates with geneticregulators, including SIR-2.1(SIRT1) and MPK-1(ERK), to control somatic longevity and reproductive system(i.e., reproductive longevity and tumorigenesis). Importantly, SIR-2.1(SIRT1) and MPK-1(ERK) activate DAF-16 (a family of the FOXO transcription factor) and SKN-1 (a family of the NRF2 transcription factor),respectively. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that RSV controls somatic longevity (Aim 1) and thereproductive system (Aim 2) through both SIR-2.1(SIRT1)àDAF16(FOXO) and MPK-1(ERK)àSKN-1(NRF2)pathways. Overall, the proposed project will enrich the infrastructure for research and education as well asincrease the participation of underrepresented groups, which fulfills the purpose of the NIH-AREA (R15) grant.In addition, our findings in a simple organism will provide new mechanistic insights into the controversialeffects of RSV on longevity, but will also have important implications regarding RSV utilization to enhance theprognosis of aging-associated diseases in vertebrates, where such in vivo methods are not feasible orpractical.',\n",

       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Tracking population-based HIV transmission dynamics is critical to design and monitor effectiveinterventions. Despite widespread prevention, HIV incidence has failed to decline among some subgroups inthe United States (US) including young men who have sex with men (MSM). Such disparities are notable in theSouthern US which is at the epicenter of the national epidemic with the greatest burden in new and prevalentinfections. Significant disparities in HIV infection exist based on race/ethnicity and risk behaviors, but also ingeography; a higher proportion of cases are reported outside large urban areas compared to other regions. Delineating HIV transmission dynamics in the Southern US can identify ongoing transmission networks orclusters where targeted prevention measures may be more impactful at reducing local incidence. However, thesuccess of such measures requires timely identification and response to emerging or expanding clusters.Prospective phylogenetic analyses of HIV sequences integrated with epidemiologic and clinical surveillancedata would facilitate the timely detection and monitoring of transmission networks. When combined withphylodynamic modeling, cluster expansion and transmission dynamics could be better predicted and theimpact of interventions assessed. Our overall hypotheses are: 1) Prospective phylogenetic cluster analysis allows timely identification oftransmission chains not apparent through routine surveillance, 2) Persons identified in expanding clustersrepresent the leading edge of local transmission, i.e. recent infection, 3) Targeting prevention towards growingclusters will identify a higher proportion of recent infections and ultimately reduce incidence. These hypotheseswill be addressed in North Carolina (NC) with three specific aims: Aim 1: To describe the demographic andgeographical characteristics of HIV transmission involving persons with newly reported HIV infection usingphylogenetic clustering, viral load, and risk behaviors; Aim 2: To assess HIV cluster expansion and informphylodynamic models by integrating large-scale deep sequencing and contact networks involving cases withnewly diagnosed HIV infection; Aim 3: To conduct a preliminary assessment of a cluster-directed partnerservices intervention to interrupt HIV transmission networks. These aims will be addressed through a combination of strategies in collaboration with the NC Departmentof Health and Human Services. A statewide prospective, automated cluster analysis system (nextHIV) will beevaluated. Sequences from reference laboratories and deep sequencing of diagnostic specimens from publictesting sites will be analyzed in near-real time. Clusters will be characterized with detailed epidemiological dataincluding HIV viral loads and contact networks. A proof-of-concept, cluster-directed partner servicesintervention will be assessed in an 11 county region with high HIV burden. Phylodynamic and mathematicalmodeling will be used to assess cluster expansion and the potential impact of interventions.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACTHeterosexual transmission of HIV-1 remains the dominant mechanism by which the epidemic is sustainedworldwide and increasingly is the route by which the virus is spreading within the US. It is now well establishedthat in a majority of transmissions, infection is initiated by a single genetic variant, the transmitted founder (TF)virus, from the transmitting partner quasispecies. This severe severe genetic bottleneck, in which one or alimited number of variants from the diverse population present in the transmitting (donor) partner establishproductive infection in the previously uninfected partner is the result of both stochastic and selective processes.Although we and others have shown that selection for less evolved (more ancestral) variants present in thedonor’s viral quasispecies are favored during selection, the biological traits that define this enhancedtransmissibility remained to be fully elucidated.In this renewal application, we are proposing 3 Specific Aims that combine cohort-level viral genetics analyses,in vitro phenotypic characterization, as well as an in vivo model for HIV-1 transmission, to define the viralproperties that are advantageous during transmission. These approaches together have the potential toprovide more definitive information on whether there are biological phenotypes of HIV-1 that are linked totransmission and could be targeted for intervention. Specifically we will: 1. Define specific virologic traits that correlate with the selection of more consensus-like viruses through a broad analysis of subtype A and C transmission pairs, coupled with novel assay methodologies. 2. Characterize the nature, impact and extent of selection bias across genomic regions and subtypes using a novel PacBio sequencing approach to define the donor quasispecies and the TF virus. 3. Determine, using humanized BLT mice, whether preferential transmission of TF viruses over donor- matched NT viruses occurs in this model and reveals viral and host determinants of transmission.A knowledge gap remains in our understanding of the genetic bottleneck associated with HIV-1 transmission.The experiments proposed will narrow this gap by conducting a thorough interrogation of the biologicalcharacteristics of the transmitted founder virus that are linked to its preferential transmission, using anexpanded panel of transmission pairs from two African cohorts and novel technologies that have not beenapplied in this setting. Such traits, if defined, could provide new avenues for specifically targeting preventionapproaches to the viruses most likely to initiate new infections.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/AbstractThe success of any bacterial pathogen ultimately depends on its ability to multiply and transmit to new hosts.Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of the human disease tuberculosis and one of the mostsuccessful pathogens in human history, likely also employs sophisticated means to spread from one person tothe next, including mediating caseation, tissue destruction, and airborne transmission. Yet, despite the toll Mtbhas taken on world health, the molecular mechanisms responsible for Mtb transmission remain elusive.Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that Mtb strains representing specific lineages are more prevalent inhumans. Differences in virulence of specific strains have been proposed to account for the spread of specificstrains. However, whether there are differences in transmission and associated factors such as coughinduction and aerosolization of bacteria is unknown. These mechanisms may also account for the spread ofmultidrug-resistant and extensively drug resistant. Thus, there is an urgent need to better characterize thetransmission dynamics of Mtb. Historical data is consistent with airborne transmission of Mtb by infected tonon-infected guinea pigs. Recently, a mouse model of tuberculosis using the C3HeB/FeJ mouse strain hasdemonstrated pathologic feature similar to human disease such as caseation and cavitation, suggesting thatthese animals may also be able to produce Mtb-containing aerosols. Thus, using both guinea pigs andC3HeB/FeJ mice, we will apply bioengineering, microbiology and animal models to characterize Mtbtransmission. In the proposed research we will (1) Construct a sophisticated Mtb transmission system tomeasure transmission, cough and aerosolized particles safely and quantitatively and (2) Use the system tocompare the transmissibility of a variety of Mtb species with known differences in worldwide prevalence andinnate virulence. The proposed work is expected to identify novel factors associated with transmission, andcreate a simple, cheap and portable system for future transmission studies that will include comparisons ofdrug-sensitive to drug-resistant Mtb.',\n",
       " 'HDV superinfection of chronic hepatitis B leads to rapid progression of liver cirrhosis, but the mechanisms that drive disease pathogenesis are not known. HDV-specific T cells have not been detected in chronic patients and only very few CD8 T cell epitopes were identified in rare recovered patients.Reasoning that a surge in viremia after lonafarnib/ritonavir antiviral therapy may boost T cell responses and facilitate epitope mapping in chronic HDV infection, we established HDV-specific T cell lines from post-treatment bleeds of chronic HDV patients and mapped CD8 T cell epitopes with pools of overlapping HDV peptides and dose titrations of 15-mer and shorter peptides. IFN-gamma production was used as read-out. With this approach, we identified nine CD8 T cell epitopes. These were used to synthesize MHC-epitope multimers and to characterize HDV-specific CD8 T cells ex vivo in untreated patients. The frequency of HDV-specific CD8 T cells was similar to that of HBV-specific CD8 T cells in HDV/HBV co-infected patients, but lower than the frequency of CMV, EBV and Flu-specific CD8 T cells.  Most virus-specific CD8 T cells were effector memory cells (CCR7+CD45RO+). About 40% of HDV- and EBV-specific CD8 T cells were activated (CD38+) as compared to about 20% of HBV-specific CD8 T cells and <10% of Flu-specific CD8 T cells, and the percentage of activated cells correlated with liver transaminases. IFN-gamma production was detected upon ex vivo peptide stimulation.  Viral sequence variations and stop codons were found in most epitope-encoding sequences. Ex vivo IFN-gamma production and viral escape mutations indicate that HDV-specific CD8 T cells are functional in vivo.',\n",
       " 'Project SummaryRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects 64 million people and causes substantial mortalityannually worldwide. There is no licensed RSV vaccine. Clinical trials of alum-adjuvanted,formalin-inactivated whole RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine caused vaccine-enhanced respiratory diseaseduring epidemic season, which resulted in hospitalizations and two deaths. It is essential that aneffective and safe RSV vaccine not induce vaccine-enhanced disease (VED) upon theimmunized person’s exposure to live RSV. Currently licensed adjuvants cannot prevent orreverse RSV VED in animals. Our studies demonstrate that virus-like particle (VLP) vaccinespresenting RSV F proteins (F VLP) confer protection against RSV by controlling lung viralreplication without causing detectable VED. In addition, our preliminary data reveals that splitRSV is safer than inactivated whole FI-RSV, and that certain Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonistcombination adjuvants further improve split RSV vaccine efficacy and safety by preventing anyresidual VED response. During this STTR phase 1 project, we will assess the efficacy andsafety of two promising novel RSV vaccine candidates in mouse and cotton ratpreclinical animal models. The first candidate is an RSV F VLP vaccine formulated as astandalone agent or in combination with split RSV vaccine. We hypothesize that it may bepossible to boost efficacy by combining these two RSV immunogens without compromisingsafety. Our second candidate is a split RSV vaccine administered with VED-preventing TLRagonist adjuvants. We have established rigorous methods for evaluating RSV vaccine safety,efficacy, and monitoring detailed innate and adaptive immunological responses in animalmodels. In Aim 1 of this project, we will focus on testing our newly developed F VLP and splitRSV vaccines standalone or in combinations for efficacy and safety in mouse models. We willalso determine whether split RSV vaccine in combination with low dose TLR agonists willimprove the efficacy of RSV vaccines while preventing VED in mice. The goal of aim 2 is toinvestigate the immunogenicity, efficacy, and pulmonary disease of new RSV vaccinecombinations (Split RSV +/- F VLP) in cotton rats after vaccination and challenge.

       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (PROJECT 2)All animals (including humans) are host to a diverse collection of microorganisms, collectively known as their“microbiome,” which is intimately involved in their health and wellbeing. Manipulating and managing themicrobiome requires understanding the forces that determine microbiome composition. Only a small fractionof microbiome variation across hosts can be explained by individual host factors, for example host genetics ordiet, leading to the perception that there are no general rules governing microbiome composition and thatengineering microbiomes for host health will be very difficult. However inter-host transmission, defined asthe movement of microbes among individual hosts, has the potential to substantially alter microbiomecomposition. This factor is frequently overlooked in microbiome studies, despite a long history of researchdemonstrating that transmission of pathogens among individual hosts can influence the diversity and functionof the pathogens. Inter-host transmission also has the potential to impact host functions modulated by themicrobiome, analogous to the transmission of disease. This process could, in theory, be harnessed to create“transmissible health,” the use of microbial transmission to improve host health without direct manipulationof individual hosts. To effectively manipulate inter-host transmission, it is crucial to understand the drivers ofvariation in rates of inter-host transmission, the conditions under which inter-host transmission has thegreatest impact on microbiome composition, and the functional consequences to the host of inter-hosttransmission. We will address each of these topics in the proposed research, by combining experimentalmanipulations with theoretical modeling to determine the nature, drivers and consequences of inter-hosttransmission of the zebrafish intestinal microbiome. The relatively simple husbandry and large clutch sizes ofzebrafish allow us to manipulate transmission of microorganisms among a large number of replicateindividuals at a scale not feasible in humans or other vertebrate models. The results of these experiments willbe synthesized in a computational model that will be broadly applicable to host-microbe systems, includinghumans. The proposed research will rigorously test the idea that health can be transmitted via dispersal ofmicrobiome members, with important implications for human medicine.',\n",
       " 'AbstractCapsule is recognized as one of the most important structures of bacterial pathogens and has a long list ofproperties that contribute to successful pathogenesis within an infected host. Recent studies from our lab haverevealed a novel role for the bacterial capsule locus in transmission between hosts. In addition, we havepreliminary results demonstrating the capsule of Bordetella bronchiseptica has a profound effect on growth andpersistence within the respiratory tract of its mammalian host. This project will explore the mechanistic detailsof these important effects by probing both the genetic and enzymatic basis for capsule assembly as well as itsbiochemical structure. We propose the following three aims:1. Determine the role of each gene in the capsule (tEPS) locus in distinct stages of transmission. Wewill construct in-frame deletion of each of the 18 genes of the transmission associated extra-polysaccharide(tEPS) capsule locus to define the role of each gene in the profound effect on transmission that we observedby deleting this locus. We will use our innovative new assay to distinguish the genes that effect the shedding ofbacteria from infected host from genes that effect the colonization of exposed animals.2. Define the contributions of key genes to the structure and physiochemical properties of tEPS. Wewill isolate, purify and study the individual mutant EPS using a combined methodology (MS and NMRplatforms) to determine the sugar sequences, linkage and structure. Relating the chemical structures andphysiochemical properties of the EPS generated by wild type and various mutants that fail to transmit (in Aim1) will reveal the specific aspects of the tEPS that are required for transmission.3. Determine the enzymatic activities encoded by genes involved in transmission. Genes determined tobe required for transmission in Aim 1 encode potential targets for interventions; blocking their enzymaticactivity could prevent transmission. We will therefore express these genes in E. coli and define the enzymaticactivities and kinetics of the critical steps.This project will reveal the chemical structure of a new capsule and identify key elements of the structure thatcontribute to the critical ability of pathogens to transmit between hosts, a key point of intervention to preventthe spread of infectious disease. It will also reveal the pathways involved in its assembly, thereby identifyingtargets for rational design of targeted treatments. Using a novel mouse model to study transmission andunderstanding how capsular polysaccharide(s) are being used by respiratory pathogens to transmit, are thenoteworthy features of this proposal and highly relevant to groups investigating infectious bacterial diseases ofthe respiratory system.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary/Abstract Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) in otherwisehealthy children, and developing an effective prophylactic vaccine to prevent RSV disease in infants is a publicand global health priority according to the World Health Organization. The specific goal of this research projectis to generate, characterize, and prioritize, in the laboratory, a pipeline of novel live attenuated RSV vaccinecandidates. We will also generate and assess live vaccine candidates against a related virus, humanmetapneumovirus (hMPV). Our long-term goal is to develop safe and efficacious RSV and hMPV vaccines forimmunizing sero-negative infants, who are beyond the reach of protective maternal antibodies, againstmedically attended RSV and hMPV LRTI. Globally, there are 34 million new RSV infections annually with 3.4million hospitalizations and 66,000 to 199,000 deaths. It was estimated that in the USA, 2 million childrenunder the age of 5 required care for RSV infections annually and 78% are over the age of one year. hMPV issecond to RSV as a major cause of infant LRTI. Vaccinating the birth cohort with a RSV vaccine that inducesimmunity similar to natural infection has been estimated to significantly reduce RSV hospitalizations andmedical costs globally. A live attenuated vaccine generally mimics natural infection, and therein lays a challenge for RSV. Onthe one hand, epidemiology and natural history studies demonstrate that natural RSV infection results inprotection of infants and children against severe RSV disease upon subsequent infection. On the other hand,natural RSV immunity is not considered robust or long lasting, so heavy attenuation of the natural virus led topoorly immunogenic live vaccines over the years. We recently published a RSV live vaccine candidate thatwas engineered to be highly attenuated in cotton rats yet retained immunogenicity similar to wild-type virus.Rather than attenuate virus replication per se, we codon-deoptimized or deleted non-essential RSV genesinvolved in virulence and immune modulation. This results in in vivo attenuation and enhancedimmunogenicity. The attenuation phenotype was genetically stable because it is conferred by hundreds ofmutations we introduced into the RSV genome. The other distinguishing characteristic is a novel fusion (F)protein that is enriched for the more immunogenic pre-F conformation. This grant expands these initialpublished findings into a vaccine discovery program to hone in an optimal RSV vaccine candidate and applythe approach to hMPV. Aims 1 and 2 will develop RSV live attenuated vaccine candidates based on optimizing virulence genemodifications and optimizing the F antigen. In Aim 3, we will utilize our RSV construct platform to generatechimeric RSV-hMPV strains as vaccine candidates against hMPV. The outcome of these studies will establisha new framework of balancing attenuation and potency and prioritize lead candidates for clinical development.',\n",

No approved RSV vaccine exists. Our goal is to define broadly protecting antibody epitopes on RSV G protein. RSV G protein is one of two major immunogenic proteins on the RSV surface and plays key roles in virus attachment to airway epithelial cells and virus modulation of innate immune defenses. Despite the important role of RSV G protein in infection and pathogenesis, little is known about the structural and molecular features that govern its activities. Our central hypothesis is that the central conserved region of RSV G protein contains both linear and conformational epitopes for broadly protecting antibodies. Using an integrated structural and biophysical approach, we will pursue two specific aims to (1) Identify RSV G protein constructs that maintain high-affinity binding to anti-G antibodies and (2) Use structural studies to define epitopes on RSV G protein recognized by broadly protecting antibodies. Results obtained by this work will provide a molecular roadmap for the development of novel RSV G vaccine immunogens to prevent RSV infection and disease.',\n",
       " 'Plague is a zoonosis that is present in wild rodent populations worldwide and is transmitted primarily by fleas. Yersinia pestis, the plague bacillus, is unique among the enteric group of gram-negative bacteria in having adopted an arthropod-borne route of transmission. Y. pestis has evolved in such a way as to be transmitted during the brief encounter between a feeding flea and a host. A transmissible infection primarily depends on the ability of Y. pestis to grow in the flea as a biofilm that is embedded in a complex extracellular matrix. Bacteria in the biofilm phenotype are deposited into the dermis together with flea saliva, elements which cannot be satisfactorily mimicked by needle-injection of Y. pestis from laboratory cultures. The objective of this project is to identify and determine the function of Y. pestis genes that mediate flea-borne transmission and the initial encounter with the host innate immune system at the infection site in the skin. We study the interaction of Y. pestis with its insect vector by using an artificial feeding apparatus to infect fleas with uniform doses of Y. pestis parent and mutant strains. We seek to identify Y. pestis genes that are required for the bacteria to infect the flea midgut and to produce a biofilm that blocks the flea foregut and that is required for efficient transmission. The strategy entails first identifying bacterial genes that are differentially expressed in the flea by gene expression analysis and other techniques. Specific mutations are then introduced into these genes, and the mutants tested for their ability to infect and block the flea vector. Identification of such transmission factors allows further studies into the molecular mechanisms of the bacterial infection of the flea vector. Detailed understanding of the interaction with the insect host may lead to novel strategies to interrupt the transmission cycle. We have also established in vitro methods to infect fleas and to monitor transmission dynamics of fleas over a one-month period following their infectious blood meal.  With this system we are able to compare the relative importance of the two modes of transmission and the relative vector competence of different flea species.  Our studies of flea vector competence and vectorial capacity will be useful to develop more realistic mathematical modeling of the epidemiology of plague transmission and the conditions that lead to plague epizootics.     During FY2018, we reported that efficiency with which fleas transmit Y. pestis can vary significantly depending on the source of their infectious bloodmeal. Fleas infected using rat blood transmit better than fleas infected using mouse blood, especially during the first week after infection (early-phase transmission).  The enhanced transmission efficiency correlated with the propensity of rat hemoglobin to crystallize in the flea gut and lead to heavier colonization of the foregut. These results are consistent with our proposed regurgitative mechanism for early-phase transmission. The relative insolubility of the hemoglobin of rats and the Sciurid family of rodents (e.g. ground squirrels, prairie dogs, and marmots) and the slower digestion of their blood appears to promote regurgitative transmission, which may be one reason why these rodents are particularly prominent in plague ecology.We implemented new experimental systems to maintain and monitor infection status and transmission efficiency of individual fleas at different times after infection.  The data are being used to estimate values for important parameters such as the probability of flea vectors developing a transmissible infection after feeding on a bacteremic host and the transmission efficiency during a four-week period after infection.  Limited data are available are currently for these values, which are needed for understanding plague epidemiology.  In collaboration with Dr. Angela Luis at the University of Montana, we have developed mathematical models to better comprehend the key conditions that give rise to periodic plague epizootics, and are using our experimentally derived data in these models to compare the relative importance of biofilm-independent (early phase) and biofilm-dependent transmission mechanisms.   We have developed standardized methods to more rigorously quantify vector competence parameters (broadly including infectivity, flea foregut blockage rate, transmission rate, and transmission efficiency) throughout a 4-week period following a single infectious blood meal); and with the help of colleagues at the USGS and elsewhere have been evaluating four flea species considered to be poor vectors.  For example, the prairie dog flea Oropsylla hirsuta had been claimed to rarely become blocked or transmit beyond the early phase, and recently published models argued that early-phase transmission was the driving force behind plague epizootics in those rodents.  Prairie dog colonies are subject to periodic explosive plague epizootics that can essentially extirpate the colony, which pose a public danger to rural communities and hinder efforts to reintroduce the black-footed ferret, an endangered species.  The conditions that give rise to prairie dog epizootics are enigmatic.  Based on one limited 1940 study, the predominant flea of prairie dogs, O. hirsuta, is a poor vector.  Because of this, alternate transmission routes in addition to the classic flea-borne route have been proposed, none of which add up. Similarly, Dr. James Belthoff, Boise State University, is providing Pulex irritans fleas, which we also evaluated. This flea is also considered to be a poor vector but has controversially been hypothesized to have transmitted Y. pestis from human to human during the European plague epidemics of the Middle Ages.  We confirmed that the human flea P. irritans is a poor vectors, but that O. hirsuta is a more efficient vector than previously recognized.  In all flea species examined,  high transmission efficiency correlated with the development of biofilm-dependent proventricular blockage.  The early-phase transmission efficiency was low in all species.  Reliable vector competence data regarding these fleas will enable more realistic modeling of these epizootiologic/epidemiologic scenarios.   Working with the RML Genomics Unit, we have completed in vivo (flea digestive tract) transcriptional profiling of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis wild-type (unable to form biofilm in the flea proventriculus), and a Y. pseudotuberculosis mutant strain that is able to produce proventricular-blocking biofilm in fleas.  Transcriptomic profiling has been performed on RNA of bacteria recovered from the digestive tract of fleas 1 day and 14 days after the infectious blood meal.  Two methods were used: 1) an improved microarray that includes all conserved and unique Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis ORFs, pseudogenes, and intergenic regions (both strands); and 2) small RNA deep sequencing (RNA-Seq).  Surprisingly, the Y. pseudotuberculosis mutations that increased c-di-GMP levels and enabled biofilm development in the flea did not change expression levels of the hmsHFRS genes responsible for the biofilm matrix.  The Y. pseudotuberculosis mutant uniquely expressed much higher levels of one of the Yersinia Type 6 secretion systems (T6SS-4) in the flea, and this locus was required for flea blockage by Y. pseudotuberculosis, but not by Y. pestis.  Major differences between the two species in expression of several metabolism genes, the Psa fimbrial genes, quorum sensing related genes, and stress response genes were evident during flea infection.  The results provide insights into how Y. pestis has adapted to life in its flea vector and point to evolutionary changes in the regulation of biofilm development pathways.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThis application is focused on the paradoxical role of innate immune and antiviral responses in thedysregulation of critical cytoprotective responses in the lung. We have previously discovered that anunbalanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the course of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)infection, the major cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in infants, is caused by a progressivereduction in nuclear and cellular levels of the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), the primaryregulator of antioxidant enzyme (AOE) gene expression. This process, which contributes to lung disease andinflammation, occurs through deacetylation and increased degradation of NRF2 via the proteasome pathwayand leads to decreased expression of AOEs in RSV-infected airway epithelial cells (AECs), in experimentalmice, as well as, in children with naturally acquired RSV LRTI. RSV-mediated NRF2 degradation occurs viathe sumoylation-dependent ubiquitin ligase RNF4, which is recruited to the promyelocytic leukemia proteinnuclear bodies (PML-NBs) in conditions of cellular oxidative stress. In the absence of IFN-dependent signaling,we found no induction of PML protein, a major component of PML-NBs, in response to RSV infection andsignificantly reduced NRF2 degradation, resulting in enhanced AOE gene expression. Moreover, mice lackingtype I IFN receptor (IFNR1 -/-) display significant reduction of lung inflammation and overall improvement inclinical disease. RSV infection in infants and young children is known to be poorly responsive to the canonicalantiviral activity of interferons (IFNs), whereas evidence of overexpression of IFN genes in lung and blood hasbeen shown to be associated with immune dysregulation. In addition, preliminary studies indicated that lack ofNF-κB activation revert RSV-induced decrease in NRF2 acetylation, restoring its cellular and nuclear levels,with subsequent increase in NRF2-dependent gene transcription and AOE gene expression. Based on thesedata, we will test the hypothesis that RSV-induced proinflammatory and antiviral pathways play a central role inthe RSV-induced demise of NRF2, leading to lung oxidative injury and ROS-dependent disease pathogenesis.These studies will provide initial experimental evidence that modulation of the IFN pathway could represent apossible target for therapeutic intervention for RSV-induced oxidative lung damage and inflammation..',\n",
       " \"The microbiome living in or on an organism is critical to that organism's health. It influences everything from growth and development to behavior to disease susceptibility. How an organism gets the best possible microbiome during its development is key to its lifetime health and reproductive success. However, we know very little about how the processes by which microbiomes are transmitted among individuals affects organism health. This knowledge gap becomes especially important when building predictions about how interfering in the transfer of microbes between individuals might matter. For example, there has been discussion of how caesarean section birth might reduce the transmission of microbiota from mother to offspring, and in agriculture there are numerous common practices, such as sterilization of seeds or crop rotation, that likely impact the movement of plant-associated microbes across generations. This research project will focus on the consequences of differences in how tomatoes, a model agricultural crop, get their microbiomes. It will compare how vertical transmission, from parent to offspring, or horizontal transmission, among unrelated organisms, affects microbiome establishment, adaptation, and function. The outcomes of this work will be relevant to the development of agricultural practices that better incorporate the potentially useful role of the plant microbiome for crop yield. Undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will also be involved in the project, and researchers will also work with local teachers to create teaching materials based on the research. The proposed work uses a model tomato plant - phyllosphere (leaf associated) microbiome system to determine both the short term (ecological) and longer-term (evolutionary) consequences of interrupted microbiome transmission between generations on host-microbiome interactions. By manipulating the likelihood that seedlings will be colonized by microbiota coming from parental plants versus unrelated plants, the work will directly test the impact of transmission mode on microbiome successional dynamics, adaptation, and function. The combination of microbial experimental evolution, culture-independent sequencing, and metagenomic analyses will allow for a causal link to be established between microbiome transmission mode and the taxonomic and functional diversity of phyllosphere microbiota. The empirical work will be complemented by theory on how vertical microbiome transmission affects host-microbiome coevolution. Together, the work will determine the importance of vertical transmission in shaping host-microbiome interactions.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " \"Downbursts, referring to downward high intensity winds associated with thunderstorms, pose a major threat to power transmission grids in many parts of the United States. Considering the distributed size of the power transmission infrastructure, significant investments will be needed in order to upgrade the existing systems and properly design new infrastructure to resist downburst wind forces. The goal of this research is to develop an integrative experimental and numerical framework that is capable of characterizing the extent of vulnerability of the power transmission infrastructure against downbursts, and identify the most critical components. The framework will provide knowledge that can help reduce outage-induced societal disruptions caused by downbursts, and thus enable continued national prosperity and welfare following a downburst event. Using this framework, various significant factors for the downburst performance of transmission systems and potential causes of past failures will be investigated. Moreover, this research will develop the first generation of downburst fragility models for transmission tower-line systems (TLSs) using experimentally validated numerical models. These fragility models are crucial for risk-informed decision making for design and management of the transmission grid in order to mitigate future failures and enhance the resiliency of the grid against extreme weather events. The numerical and experimental studies will provide the knowledge needed to enhance design methodologies to include downburst wind loads for transmission line systems. The research findings will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses at Florida International University (FIU) and The Ohio State University to better prepare the future generation of infrastructure engineers. Project data will be archived and publicly shared in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org/). This research will develop an integrative experimental and numerical framework to characterize the fragility of transmission line systems against downbursts. The experimental research will involve developing a versatile downburst simulator at the NSF-supported NHERI Wall of Wind (WOW) Experimental Facility (EF) at FIU. Using this simulator, a scaled, aeroelastic multi-span TLS will be tested; the results will be used to experimentally validate high-fidelity finite element models of coupled transmission tower-insulator-conductor-foundation systems. Through these experimental and numerical investigations, new knowledge will be gained with regard to the aerodynamic behavior of conductors and drag and shielding effects on lattice tower sections under non-synoptic downburst wind fields. Moreover, these investigations will reveal extreme nonlinear behaviors of transmission line systems in post-elastic regimes when towers are damaged or conductors fail. The research also will provide new physics-based insights into the role of uncertainties in the downburst performance of TLSs. Failure modes that are unique to or are more likely to occur under non-synoptic downburst loadings, as compared to those under synoptic hurricane loadings, will be identified and characterized. The produced data and models will be integrated to develop the first generation of multi-dimensional demand and fragility surfaces for TLSs under downbursts at component- and system-levels using highly efficient and accurate machine learning techniques. In addition, the experimental downburst simulator at the NHERI WOW EF at FIU will provide the natural hazards community with a unique testbed with dual simulation capabilities to generate both non-synoptic and synoptic winds and analyze the impacts on buildings and other structural systems.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " \"Everyday life abounds with information from a multitude of sources. But how do individuals discern important information from that which can or should be disregarded? Most of the research on learning in humans and other animals has focused on models in which information is acquired via first-hand experience. Direct exposure to an event, however, is not the only way that individuals gather knowledge or form memories. Evidence suggests that humans and other primates can develop fear associations from a social context, by observing or interacting with others. For example, a person may have an intense fear of snakes despite having never come across a live snake. In today's society, the likelihood of witnessing traumatic episodes and indirectly acquiring fear is magnified by the omnipresence of technology and constant access to the news and social media. Like humans, rats are very social animals and learn to infer information about their environment through their interactions with other rats. The PI's laboratory has recently developed a procedure by which rats acquire fear through social transmission (a model called fear conditioning by proxy). Fear conditioning by proxy provides a sensitive means of examining how social information is transferred between individuals. A different model, social transmission of food preference, allows the investigators to examine the transmission of appetitive or rewarding information. By executing the two different and complementary paradigms in parallel (fear conditioning by proxy and social transmission of food preference), the investigators will be able to isolate factors that selectively underlie social transmission of information from those which are specific to a given paradigm. This is important, because identifying the social and mechanistic factors contribute to how people acquire fear could also lead to interventions that extinguish or diminish fears that are socially acquired.The objective of the project is to identify the social factors and neural mechanisms that foster transmission of information between members of a species, and determine what accounts for the broad variability in individuals' propensity to learn via social transmission. First, the investigators will identify factors (e.g., dominance status, kinship) that promote social transmission of information using two complementary behavioral paradigms: fear conditioning by proxy and social transmission of food preference. Second, the investigators will disambiguate the neural networks that are unique to social transmission of information, and those that are shared with learning through direct experience, using a sophisticated technique that allows selective labeling of cells involved in a given task at a specific time. Third, the investigators will test their prediction that a specific population of cells in the lateral hypothalamus accounts for individual differences in fear conditioning by proxy and social transmission of food preference. This project combines sophisticated and thorough behavioral tests, as well as complementary cellular and anatomical methods to address the neural mechanisms that drive behavioral differences. A strength of these techniques is that they will provide high spatial and temporal resolution, while allowing for on-going sampling of behavior, to understand how knowledge is transferred between individuals.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " \"Energy systems are transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind. Despite their obvious environmental advantages, large-scale integration of renewable energy faces a number of technical difficulties. These challenges are linked to the fact that the availability of renewable energy, i.e., wind and sunlight, depends on nature rather than the controllable process of burning a fuel. This project develops innovative software tools that enable the deployment of flexible transmission, which is a cost-effective solution to address these challenges. As a result of these developments, system operators will be able to benefit from a new resource that was not available to them before. Particularly, this project aims to employ flexible transmission in order to alleviate the uncertainty and intermittency of renewable energy resources, and facilitate higher levels of renewable energy production. With the help of efficient mathematical modeling and high-performance computing, the models developed in this project are fast and appropriate for real-time operation. As renewable energy is economical and emission-free, this project will have a significant positive impact on the national health, prosperity, and welfare. Additionally, this project will integrate computational methods and algorithm development in power engineering education to fill a much-needed gap in power engineering curriculum.The objective of this project is to enable frequent utilization of flexible transmission for one of the largest and most complex cyber-physical system that exists today: the North American power grid. Co-optimization of flexible transmission and generation dispatch is not possible yet due to the computational burden of the underlying mathematical problem. Specifically, transmission flexibility, in the form of controllable impedance, introduces non-convexities to power system operation that are challenging to handle within the limited available computational time. This project substantially reduces such computational burden through a novel and fast optimization technique, which exploits the mathematical structure of power flows. Consequently, utilization of flexible transmission can become possible which can help reduce the operation cost and improve the system reliability. This project also aims to mitigate the intermittencies and uncertainties associated with renewable generation by utilizing transmission flexibility. It employs stochastic optimization as the mathematical framework to model renewable energy uncertainties, and optimizes flexible transmission and controllable generation as the decision variables. Algorithm decomposition and high-performance computing are employed to reduce the solution time required for stochastic optimization in order to ensure fast and efficient computation. This is an essential component of the project as the computational time available for real-time operation is less than five minutes. The education component of this project enriches the power engineering curriculum, by developing educational modules, on computational methods, algorithm design, and high-performance computing for power engineering students.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " 'Summary Despite having reduced malaria transmission to historically low level, in many Asia-Pacific countries endemic areas transmission continues and common vector control tools seem not able to interrupt transmission. The reasons for the resilience of malaria transmission are on unclear but are likely to involve not only parasite but also host and vector factors. At low transmission, asymptomatic infections account for up to 90% of infections and it they are able to transmit efficiently they could be a key component of the infectious reservoir. The only way to accurately ascertain if an infection can transmit is to feed the blood to mosquitoes and determine rate and density of infections of the mosquito midgut. Such xenodiagnostic studies are severely lacking, in particular in predominantly P. vivax endemic area. We are now proposing to conduct an in-depth dissection of the contribution of host, parasite and vector factors to maintaining malaria transmission by conducting a set studies that combine assessment of the infectivity of well characterized field samples using direct membrane feeding (DFMA) with in-depth laboratory studies in 3 sites with substantially different transmission scenarios. Initially we will investigate the relative infectivity of asymptomatic and symptomatic infections establish the association of parasite and gametocytes density with infectivity and study effect of transmission blocking immunity, vector microbiome and type parasite for gene associated with evasion of mosquito immune responses and markers of artemisinin and partner drugs resistance to determine their effect on transmission potential. As parasite and gametocyte fluctuate over time, so may their infectivity. We will therefore determine the temporal variation in infectivity an in-depth cohort study in PNG, where asymptomatic carriers will be followed for 3 weeks and mosquitoes fed every 3-4 days. Addition, we will determine proportion of pre- and post-treatment infectivity in in artemisinin-resistant and sensitive symptomatic P. falciparum. Together with our large epidemiological datasets (see Project 1), this will allow us not only clarify the contribution of asymptomatic infections to transmission but also resistance may come with a transmission associated fitness cost, which may slow down the spread of resistance. Both human and vector behavior may limit human-vector contact in the Asia-Pacific, where vectors are frequently / predominantly outdoor biting, leading to transmission away from people’s dwelling. The low biting rate and unclear location of human-vector contact makes it difficult to identify its determinants. We will we study patterns of human vector contact by determining the presence of antibodies against salivary gland protein antibodies proteins from An. dirus. An. minimus and An. Farauti in samples from cross-sectional and cohort studies in Project 1. By providing an in-depth understanding of the transmission characteristics at each of our sites, the proposed studies will not only contribute to developing biologically accurate transmission models but will help us design better methods to track and eliminate transmission even in hard to track populations such asymptomatic carriers.']"
